        I Hate Cooking: A Meal Plan for People Who&apos;d Rather Not

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Not everyone finds cooking therapeutic. Not everyone watches cooking TikToks
          and feels inspired to make homemade pasta from scratch on a Tuesday night.
          Some people genuinely hate it &mdash; the prep, the waiting, the cleanup,
          the fact that you spend 45 minutes making something that disappears in 10.
          All of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that&apos;s fine. You&apos;re not broken. You don&apos;t need to &quot;learn
          to love it.&quot; Cooking is a chore for most people, just like laundry and
          cleaning the bathroom. The internet romanticizes it, but that&apos;s not
          reality for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here&apos;s the problem: you still need to eat. And{" "}

            DoorDash is draining your bank account
          </Link>
          . The average delivery app user spends $300-450 per month. That&apos;s $3,600
          to $5,400 a year on someone else making your food and a stranger driving it
          to your door.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here&apos;s the deal: you don&apos;t have to become a home chef. You just
          need a minimum viable cooking plan &mdash; the least amount of effort that
          keeps you fed, healthy-ish, and not broke.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* It's okay to hate cooking */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        It&apos;s Okay to Hate Cooking
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Let&apos;s get this out of the way: there&apos;s nothing wrong with you.
          The cooking-as-self-care narrative is real for some people and completely
          fictional for others. Some people love doing laundry too. Most don&apos;t.
          Nobody writes think pieces about how you should learn to find joy in folding
          socks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cooking is a life skill, not a hobby you&apos;re obligated to enjoy. You
          need to eat. You want to spend less money. You probably want to eat
          something that isn&apos;t fast food every single day. Those are practical
          goals, not lifestyle transformations.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let&apos;s approach this practically. Here are four tiers of &quot;cooking&quot;
          &mdash; and the first one barely counts.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* The 5-minute meal tier */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The 5-Minute Meal Tier
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          These barely count as cooking. No heat required for most of them. If you can
          open a package and spread something on bread, you can do these.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Toast with toppings.</strong> Peanut butter and banana. Avocado
            with salt and lemon. Cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning. Ricotta
            with honey. Toast is a canvas, not a snack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wraps.</strong> Tortilla, deli meat, cheese, lettuce, mustard.
            Roll it up. You&apos;re done. This is a $9 sandwich shop wrap for $1.50
            in ingredients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Yogurt bowls.</strong> Yogurt, granola, fruit, honey. Four
            ingredients, zero cooking, genuinely good for you. This is a complete
            breakfast or lunch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cheese plate.</strong> Cheese, crackers, some fruit, maybe deli
            meat or nuts. This is what fancy restaurants call &quot;charcuterie&quot;
            and charge $22 for. At home it&apos;s $4 and you&apos;re eating it on
            your couch. No shame.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deli sandwich.</strong> Good bread, good deli meat, good cheese,
            lettuce, tomato, mayo. This is a real meal. People eat sandwiches for
            lunch every day and nobody questions it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are all real meals. If someone tells you a yogurt bowl isn&apos;t dinner,
          that person can cook their own dinner. You&apos;re fed, you spent $2, and
          you didn&apos;t open a delivery app. Win.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* The 15-minute tier */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The 15-Minute &quot;Fine, I&apos;ll Cook&quot; Tier
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          On the nights when you can tolerate 15 minutes in the kitchen, these are your
          go-tos. Set a timer. When it beeps, you eat.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Pasta with jar sauce.</strong> Boil water. Add pasta. Drain.
            Add sauce from a jar. That&apos;s four steps. Add parmesan if you have it.
            Total active effort: about 3 minutes of actual work, 10 minutes of waiting
            for water to boil (during which you can do literally anything else).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quesadillas.</strong> Tortilla in a pan. Cheese on half. Fold.
            Flip when brown. Cut into triangles. Add salsa. This takes 5 minutes and
            tastes like the $11 appetizer at a Mexican restaurant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scrambled eggs.</strong> Butter in pan, crack eggs, stir. Add
            cheese, put on toast or eat alone. Five minutes, one pan, one plate. If
            this is dinner, it&apos;s dinner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frozen stir-fry + rice.</strong> Microwave rice (those 90-second
            pouches are a miracle). Dump a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables in a pan
            with oil and soy sauce. Combine. This looks and tastes like you cooked.
            You didn&apos;t, really. But nobody needs to know.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sheet pan whatever.</strong> Cut up any vegetable and protein, throw
            on a sheet pan with oil and salt, put in oven at 400&deg;F for 20 minutes.
            Okay this one is 20 minutes, but 18 of those minutes the oven does the work
            and you&apos;re on your phone.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          If you hate the active part of cooking &mdash; standing at the stove, stirring,
          watching, timing &mdash; these are for you. Put stuff in a machine, press a
          button, leave.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Slow cooker dump meals.</strong> Put chicken thighs, a jar of salsa,
            and a can of black beans in a slow cooker. Set to low for 6-8 hours. Come
            home to shredded chicken tacos. You &quot;cooked&quot; for 3 minutes.
            Other combos: chicken + BBQ sauce, beef + potatoes + broth, sausage +
            peppers + onions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rice cooker meals.</strong> Rice cookers aren&apos;t just for rice.
            Add rice, broth, diced vegetables, and protein. Press cook. Walk away.
            Come back to a one-pot meal. Some rice cookers even have slow cooker
            and steam functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Instant pot magic.</strong> Frozen chicken breast + broth + seasoning
            = shredded chicken in 25 minutes, no thawing needed. Dried beans + water =
            cooked beans in 30 minutes, no soaking. The Instant Pot exists for people
            who want food without the process.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The theme here: your total hands-on time is 3-5 minutes. You&apos;re not
          cooking. You&apos;re pressing buttons. Different skill set.

        Assembly, Not Cooking
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s a mental shift that helps: stop thinking about &quot;cooking&quot;
          and start thinking about &quot;assembling.&quot; You&apos;re not a chef.
          You&apos;re a food assembler. Big difference.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Grain bowls.</strong> Microwave rice, add rotisserie chicken (from
            the store &mdash; $6 and already cooked), add whatever vegetables you have,
            drizzle sauce. You assembled a $14 Sweetgreen bowl for $3.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Salads with pre-cooked protein.</strong> Bag of pre-washed greens,
            rotisserie chicken or canned tuna, cherry tomatoes, cheese, dressing from a
            bottle. This is assembly, not cooking. It&apos;s healthy. It takes 4 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wraps and burritos.</strong> Tortilla + whatever is in your fridge.
            Leftover rice? Goes in the wrap. Canned beans? Goes in the wrap. Random
            cheese? Goes in the wrap. Wraps are the duct tape of meals &mdash; they hold
            anything together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Snack plates.</strong> Hummus, crackers, sliced vegetables, cheese,
            deli meat, fruit. Arrange on a plate. This is a legitimate dinner in many
            European countries. It&apos;s also a legitimate dinner in your apartment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      {/* Or just don't cook */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Or Just&hellip; Don&apos;t Cook
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s the truth nobody tells you: you don&apos;t have to cook every
          night. You don&apos;t even have to cook most nights. The goal isn&apos;t to
          become a home cook &mdash; it&apos;s to spend less on food while eating
          reasonably well.
        </p>
        <p>
          A realistic plan looks like this:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>2-3 nights: simple cooking (15-minute meals from above)</li>
          <li>2 nights: assembly meals (bowls, wraps, plates)</li>
          <li>1-2 nights: takeout or eating out</li>
          <li>1 night: leftovers or snack dinner</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That&apos;s not a &quot;meal plan.&quot; That&apos;s just real life with a
          little structure. Even this partial approach saves $200+ per month compared
          to ordering delivery every night.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here&apos;s where a meal plan actually helps people who hate cooking:
          the plan removes the <em>deciding</em>, which is the worst part. You don&apos;t
          have to browse recipes. You don&apos;t have to figure out what goes with what.
          You don&apos;t have to build a grocery list. The plan does all of that. You
          just follow it on the nights you can manage and ignore it on the nights you
          can&apos;t.
