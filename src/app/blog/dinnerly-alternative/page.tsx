        Dinnerly Alternative: Simple Meals Without the Box
      </h1>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Dinnerly built its brand on a smart premise: not everyone needs
          truffle oil and heirloom tomatoes in their meal kit. Strip out the
          fancy ingredients, use digital recipe cards instead of printed ones,
          keep recipes to 6 ingredients or less, and pass the savings on. At
          $5&ndash;7/serving, it&apos;s one of the cheapest meal kits on the
          market.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is, &quot;cheapest meal kit&quot; is a bit like
          &quot;cheapest luxury car.&quot; You&apos;re still paying a premium
          for the format. Those 6 ingredients in your Dinnerly box? They cost
          $1.50&ndash;2.50 at the grocery store. You&apos;re paying double for
          someone to bag them separately and ship them in a box with ice packs.
          If you liked Dinnerly&apos;s simplicity but want to stop overpaying
          for it, here&apos;s the move.
        </p>
      </div>

        Why people are leaving Dinnerly
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          <strong>Still more expensive than cooking from scratch.</strong>{" "}
          Dinnerly&apos;s whole pitch is affordability, but $5&ndash;7/serving
          plus $9&ndash;10 shipping adds up. A couple doing 3 dinners/week
          spends $70&ndash;95/month. A family of four hits $130&ndash;180/month.
          That same money buys 2&ndash;3 weeks of full groceries at Aldi — for
          every meal, not just 3 dinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Very limited menu.</strong> Budget cuts come at a cost.
          Dinnerly typically offers 16&ndash;20 recipes per week with no
          dietary-specific filters. Compared to HelloFresh&apos;s 30+ options
          with calorie-smart and protein-smart tracks, Dinnerly feels
          barebones. After a couple months, the recipes start blurring
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simplicity becomes monotony.</strong> Six-ingredient recipes
          are great for beginners. But after 8 weeks of one-pan pastas and
          sheet-pan proteins, you want something with a bit more range. The
          simplicity that initially attracted you starts feeling limiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Same packaging problem as every kit.</strong> Budget pricing
          doesn&apos;t mean less waste. Every Dinnerly box has the same
          insulated liner, ice packs, and individual plastic bags as a
          HelloFresh box. The carbon footprint per meal is essentially
          identical.

          Dinnerly proved something important: people don&apos;t need

          Every week, you get an AI-generated meal plan built around your
          dietary preferences, household size, and cooking ability. The recipes
          are designed to be practical — most take 20&ndash;30 minutes with
          ingredients you can find at any grocery store. A{" "}

          WFD is the logical next step.
