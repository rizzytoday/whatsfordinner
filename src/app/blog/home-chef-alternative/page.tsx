        Best Home Chef Alternative: Same Recipes, 90% Cheaper
      </h1>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Home Chef has carved out a nice niche in the meal kit world. Their
          oven-ready options and simpler recipes appeal to people who want
          home-cooked meals without much effort. Slide a tray in the oven, set
          a timer, done. It&apos;s like hiring a prep cook who shows up in a
          cardboard box every week.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at $8&ndash;10 per serving, you&apos;re paying someone a
          significant premium to put grocery store ingredients in plastic bags
          with a recipe card. The chicken breast in your Home Chef box is the
          same chicken breast at your Kroger — it just costs 4&ndash;5x more
          because someone portioned it. If that math has started bothering you,
          let&apos;s talk about what&apos;s actually worth paying for.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* --- Why people are leaving Home Chef --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Why people are leaving Home Chef
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          <strong>The price-per-serving math.</strong> Home Chef runs
          $8&ndash;10/serving for standard meals and up to $12 for premium
          options. A family of four ordering 3 dinners/week pays
          $96&ndash;144/week — that&apos;s <strong>$384&ndash;576/month</strong>{" "}
          for just 3 dinners. The other 18 meals? Still on you. Most families
          spending $400+ on Home Chef are also spending $200+ on regular
          groceries, pushing total food costs past $600/month easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Limited customization.</strong> You pick from a rotating menu
          of roughly 25&ndash;30 meals. There are a few dietary filters (low
          calorie, carb conscious, vegetarian) but nothing for halal, kosher,
          FODMAP, or specific cultural cuisines. If your household has mixed
          dietary needs, Home Chef basically shrugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The packaging avalanche.</strong> Every ingredient in its own
          bag. Ice packs. Insulated liners. Individual sauce packets. Multiply
          by 3 boxes per week, 52 weeks per year. The trash pile is real, and
          most of it isn&apos;t practically recyclable regardless of what the
          labels say.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Recipes get repetitive.</strong> After 3&ndash;4 months, you
          start seeing the same dishes recycled with minor variations. The
          honey garlic chicken becomes the teriyaki garlic chicken. The
          southwest bowl becomes the fiesta bowl. The novelty fades but the
          price stays.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s what Home Chef actually solves: it tells you what to cook
          and gives you the ingredients. That&apos;s it. The recipe is the
          valuable part. The pre-portioned bags of onions and chicken thighs?
          Those are just groceries with a markup.

          interests, and budget. A{" "}

          <li>Pre-portioned ingredients (you measure things yourself)</li>

          <li>Oven-ready trays (you do the actual cooking, 20&ndash;30 minutes)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For anyone who&apos;s been on Home Chef longer than 3 months, the
          novelty of pre-portioned bags has worn off. What you actually valued
          was knowing what dinner was. That doesn&apos;t need a box.

        Side-by-side comparison
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          <strong>Price:</strong> Home Chef costs $8&ndash;10/serving
          ($384&ndash;576/month for a family of four, 3 dinners/week).
          What&apos;s For Dinner is $7.99/month + groceries at regular store
          prices (~$2&ndash;3/serving).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Personalization:</strong> Home Chef offers 25&ndash;30
          rotating options with basic filters. WFD generates unlimited original
          meals tailored to your exact dietary needs, allergies, and cuisine
          preferences every single week.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dietary support:</strong> Home Chef has low-calorie,
          carb-conscious, and vegetarian filters. WFD supports any dietary
          restriction you can describe — including cultural, religious, and
          medical requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Convenience:</strong> Home Chef is semi-prepared (some oven-ready,
          some require 30 min cooking). WFD requires 20&ndash;30 minutes of
          cooking per meal, but eliminates all planning and decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Environmental impact:</strong> Home Chef ships individual
          ingredient bags in insulated boxes weekly. WFD generates zero
          packaging waste — you shop at your local store.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coverage:</strong> Home Chef covers 3&ndash;6 dinners/week.
          WFD covers every meal, every day — breakfast, lunch, dinner, and
          snacks.
