      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Grocery prices have gone up 25% since 2020. The average American
          household now spends over $475/month on groceries, and that number
          climbs fast if you&apos;re relying on takeout, meal kits, or
          impulse shopping. The single most effective way to cut food costs
          isn&apos;t clipping coupons or buying generic brands &mdash;
          it&apos;s having a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Households that meal plan spend roughly 25% less on groceries than
          those that wing it. The savings come from three places: you waste
          less food (you only buy what you&apos;ll actually cook), you make
          fewer impulse purchases (you shop from a list), and you order less
          takeout (you always know what&apos;s for dinner). A good budget
          meal plan pays for itself many times over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the 5 best budget meal plan options in 2026, tested against
          a target of under $75/week in groceries for two people.

        1. What&apos;s For Dinner &mdash; AI budget meal plans ($7.99/mo)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          What&apos;s For Dinner is the only budget meal plan service that
          genuinely personalizes plans to your household. You set your budget
          tier (budget, moderate, or flexible), dietary restrictions, allergies,
          cuisine preferences, and household size during a 2-minute onboarding.
          Every week, AI generates a completely original meal plan with recipes
          and a consolidated grocery list, delivered to your inbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the budget tier, the AI prioritizes affordable ingredients &mdash;
          chicken thighs over salmon, seasonal produce over imported, pantry
          staples as building blocks. The grocery list separates &ldquo;key
          buys&rdquo; (things you need to purchase) from &ldquo;pantry
          staples&rdquo; (things you probably have), so you skip unnecessary
          purchases. In our testing, budget-tier plans consistently came in
          under $65/week for two people.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <strong>$7.99/month</strong> ($5/mo on the yearly plan),
          it&apos;s the most cost-effective way to get personalized meal
          planning. The free 3-day trial requires no signup and no credit card.

        2. Budget Bytes Meal Plans &mdash; Great recipes, no personalization ($8/mo)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Budget Bytes has been the gold standard for budget cooking content
          since 2009. Beth Moncel started the site by documenting every penny
          spent on every recipe, and that transparency remains the brand&apos;s
          strongest feature. Every recipe shows a per-serving cost breakdown,
          and the food is genuinely good &mdash; not sad budget food, but
          flavorful meals that happen to be cheap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meal plan subscription ($8/mo) gives you weekly plans built from
          their recipe library, including a grocery list. The recipes are
          excellent. The problem is personalization &mdash; there isn&apos;t
          any. Everyone gets the same plan. There&apos;s no dietary
          customization, no allergy support, no household size adjustment, and
          no way to exclude ingredients you don&apos;t like. If the weekly plan
          includes something you can&apos;t eat, your only option is to swap
          it manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The free recipe archive is the real value here. Even without the meal
          plan subscription, you can browse hundreds of budget recipes with
          cost breakdowns and build your own plan.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        3. $5 Meal Plan &mdash; Budget plans via email ($5/mo)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          $5 Meal Plan is one of the original budget meal planning services.
          The concept is simple: for $5/month, you get a weekly meal plan
          emailed to you with recipes and a grocery list. The plans are
          designed to keep your grocery bill under $50/week for a family of
          four (closer to $30-40/week for two people), using affordable
          ingredients and straightforward recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plans tend to be practical and family-friendly &mdash; think
          taco night, pasta bakes, sheet pan chicken. They&apos;re not
          gourmet, but they&apos;re reliable and genuinely budget-conscious.
          You can choose between a standard plan and a gluten-free plan.
          Beyond that, there&apos;s no customization. No cuisine preferences,
          no allergy support beyond gluten-free, no household size adjustment.
        </p>
        <p>
          At $5/month, it&apos;s the cheapest subscription option. The trade-off
          is that you get a generic plan &mdash; not one built for your
          specific household.

      {/* --- #4 USDA MyPlate --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        4. USDA MyPlate Budget Plan &mdash; Free government resource
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The USDA&apos;s MyPlate program offers free weekly meal plans
          designed for budget-conscious families. The plans are built around
          the USDA&apos;s &ldquo;Thrifty Food Plan&rdquo; &mdash; the same
          framework used to calculate SNAP benefits. Recipes use basic,
          affordable ingredients (canned beans, frozen vegetables, chicken,
          rice) and include nutritional information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The content is solid from a nutritional standpoint. Every plan
          meets USDA dietary guidelines, and the recipes are genuinely
          cheap &mdash; most meals come in under $2/serving. The MyPlate
          website also has tools for tracking your food groups and finding
          recipes by ingredient.
        </p>
        <p>
          The downside is usability. The website feels like a government
          website (because it is). There&apos;s no app, no email delivery,
          no grocery list generation, and no personalization beyond choosing
          a calorie level. The recipes tend to be nutritionally optimized
          rather than flavor-optimized, which means they can feel bland.
          But it&apos;s free, evidence-based, and genuinely helpful for
          people on very tight budgets.

          The most old-school budget meal planning method is still one of
          the most effective: check your grocery store&apos;s weekly circular,
          see what proteins and produce are on sale, and plan your meals
          around that. Chicken thighs on sale for $1.49/lb? That&apos;s three
          dinners this week. Broccoli buy-one-get-one? Stir fry, roasted
          broccoli, and broccoli soup. You build the plan around what&apos;s
          cheapest, not what sounds good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most grocery stores publish their circulars online (Kroger, Walmart,
          Aldi, Publix all have apps with digital flyers). Spend 15 minutes
          on Sunday scanning the deals, plan 5-7 meals around the sale items,
          and write your grocery list. This method consistently produces the
          lowest grocery bills because you&apos;re buying at the lowest price
          points, not paying retail for whatever a recipe calls for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trade-off is time and skill. You need to know how to turn
          &ldquo;chicken thighs are $1.49/lb&rdquo; into three different
          dinners. You need recipes in your head or bookmarked. And you need
          15-30 minutes every week to scan circulars and plan. For experienced
          cooks, this is the most cost-effective method. For everyone else,
          combining this approach with a meal planning app gives you the best
          of both worlds.

          The most effective approach for most people is combining a
          personalized meal plan with smart shopping. The plan tells you{" "}
          <em>what</em> to cook. Smart shopping (buying sale items, using
          pantry staples, avoiding waste) keeps the cost down. Together,
          they&apos;re how you eat well on $75/week or less.
