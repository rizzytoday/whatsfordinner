        Splitting Groceries with Roommates: 3 Systems That Work
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The roommate grocery cold war is real. You bought milk on Monday.
          It&apos;s gone by Wednesday. Nobody claims responsibility. Someone
          left a Post-it on their almond butter that says &quot;MINE &mdash;
          DO NOT TOUCH.&quot; The shared olive oil bottle has been empty for
          two weeks because everyone assumes someone else will replace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Living with roommates means navigating fridge politics. Who bought
          the eggs? Can you use their sriracha? Is it cool to eat the last
          slice of bread if you&apos;ll buy the next loaf? These questions
          sound trivial, but they&apos;ve ended friendships.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesn&apos;t have to be this stressful. You just need a system
          that everyone agrees on before the first grocery run. Here are the
          three that actually work &mdash; and two that definitely don&apos;t.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Systems that DON'T work */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Systems That DON&apos;T Work
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Let&apos;s get these out of the way first, because almost every
          roommate household tries one of these before learning the hard way:
        </p>
        <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-100 rounded-xl p-5 my-4">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-2">&quot;We&apos;ll just share everything&quot;</h3>
          <p>
            This sounds great during the first-week honeymoon phase. Everyone
            throws money into a shared pot, someone shops, everyone eats.
            The problem shows up in week three: one roommate is eating $15
            steaks while another eats rice and beans. One person drinks a
            gallon of oat milk per week while the other uses a splash on
            Saturday. Someone&apos;s vegan and subsidizing everyone
            else&apos;s chicken. The person who eats least always feels
            ripped off. It&apos;s communism for the fridge, and it has the
            same failure mode.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-100 rounded-xl p-5 my-4">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-2">&quot;I&apos;ll label my stuff&quot;</h3>
          <p>
            Labels feel like a solution but they&apos;re actually a symptom.
            If you&apos;re writing your name on yogurt cups with a Sharpie,
            trust has already broken down. The fridge starts looking like an
            evidence locker. Every meal involves reading tags to figure out
            what you&apos;re &quot;allowed&quot; to eat. It breeds
            passive-aggression and makes the kitchen feel hostile instead of
            shared. Labels treat the symptom (someone ate my food) without
            fixing the cause (there&apos;s no agreed system).
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* System 1 */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        System 1: Shared Staples, Separate Proteins
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          This is the most popular system for a reason &mdash; it&apos;s fair,
          it&apos;s simple, and it accounts for different eating habits.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Shared:</strong> Cooking oil, salt, pepper, basic spices,
            rice, pasta, bread, eggs, milk, butter, condiments (ketchup,
            mustard, soy sauce). These are the things everyone uses a little
            bit of and nobody wants to buy separately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Separate:</strong> Meat, fish, specialty items, snacks,
            drinks, anything expensive or personal. Your protein, your
            problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tracking:</strong> Use Splitwise or a shared note. When
            someone buys shared items, they log it. Settle up monthly via
            Venmo or cash. Keep it simple &mdash; don&apos;t nickel-and-dime
            over a $2 difference.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Best for:</strong> 2-3 roommates who cook regularly and eat
          similar types of food. Works especially well when everyone has
          roughly the same grocery budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> The shared staples cost is roughly
          equal per person ($20-30/month each) and the expensive stuff
          (proteins, specialty diet items) is each person&apos;s own
          responsibility. Nobody subsidizes someone else&apos;s expensive
          taste.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* System 2 */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        System 2: Cooking Nights Rotation
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          This is the system for roommates who actually like each other. It
          turns grocery splitting into a shared activity instead of an
          accounting exercise.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            Each roommate cooks dinner 2 nights per week. Everyone eats.
          </li>
          <li>
            The remaining nights are leftovers, eating out, or fend-for-yourself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rotate who shops each week, or split the list. One shared
            grocery fund &mdash; each person contributes equally at the
            start of the month.
          </li>
          <li>
            Breakfasts and lunches are still separate (everyone has different
            schedules anyway).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Best for:</strong> 2-3 roommates who enjoy cooking, eat
          similar foods, and have compatible schedules. This system builds
          genuine community &mdash; some of the best roommate memories happen
          around shared dinners.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> Everyone contributes equally in both
          money and effort. You eat better because you&apos;re only cooking
          twice a week but eating home-cooked food four or five times. It
          also builds cooking skills &mdash; peer pressure to not serve
          cereal for dinner is a powerful motivator.
        </p>
        <p>
          This system pairs incredibly well with a shared{" "}

            meal plan
          </Link>
          . Instead of each person figuring out what to cook on their nights,
          you all follow the same plan. One grocery list, one shopping trip,
          zero &quot;what should I make?&quot; stress.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* System 3 */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        System 3: Completely Separate
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Sometimes the best system is no sharing at all. And that&apos;s
          totally fine.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            Each person gets a designated shelf (or shelves) in the fridge
            and pantry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everyone buys their own everything &mdash; oil, spices, milk,
            all of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional: one small shared condiment shelf for things like
            ketchup and soy sauce, replaced by whoever finishes it.
          </li>
          <li>
            No tracking, no settling up, no apps. Your food is your food.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Best for:</strong> 4+ roommates, roommates with very
          different diets (vegan and carnivore under one roof), or situations
          where trust is low. Also great for people who just want zero
          friction &mdash; some people don&apos;t want to coordinate,
          and that&apos;s valid.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why it works:</strong> There&apos;s nothing to argue about.
          Nobody eats your food because there&apos;s no ambiguity about whose
          food is whose. The downside is you might end up with four bottles
          of olive oil in the pantry, but that&apos;s a small price for
          zero drama.

        The Meal Plan Shortcut
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s the move that solves both problems at once &mdash; what
          to eat AND how to split groceries: get one shared meal plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          What&apos;s For Dinner generates a weekly meal plan with recipes
          and a consolidated grocery list. If you&apos;re using System 2
          (cooking rotation), everyone follows the same plan. The grocery
          list tells you exactly what to buy. Split the $7.99/mo subscription
          between roommates &mdash; that&apos;s $2.66/person for three
          people or $2/person for four.
        </p>
        <p>
          This eliminates the two biggest roommate kitchen problems
          simultaneously: &quot;what are we eating?&quot; and &quot;who&apos;s
          buying what?&quot; The plan decides what you&apos;re eating. The
          grocery list decides what to buy. You just divide the list or take
          turns shopping.
