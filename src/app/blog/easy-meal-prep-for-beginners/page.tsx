        Easy Meal Prep for Beginners: 1 Hour, Done for the Week
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Meal prep has a branding problem. Search &quot;meal prep&quot; on
          Instagram and you&apos;ll see rows of identical glass containers with
          perfectly portioned chicken, broccoli, and brown rice. Every container
          looks the same. Every meal is the same. It looks organized. It also
          looks absolutely miserable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Real meal prep &mdash; the kind that normal people actually stick
          with &mdash; looks nothing like that. It&apos;s cooking a few
          building blocks on Sunday and turning them into different meals during
          the week. Same ingredients, different combinations. No matching
          containers required. No culinary degree needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;ve tried meal prep before and quit because you couldn&apos;t
          face another identical tupperware lunch, this is for you. One hour on
          Sunday. Varied meals all week. Here&apos;s the system.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* What meal prep actually is */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        What Meal Prep Actually Is (Not 5 Identical Tupperwares)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Forget everything you&apos;ve seen on social media. Meal prep is not
          cooking 5 identical meals and eating them in order like a sad assembly
          line. That works for maybe 3% of people &mdash; competitive
          bodybuilders and robots.
        </p>
        <p>
          For everyone else, meal prep means <strong>cooking components,
          not complete meals</strong>. You cook a batch of protein. You cook a
          grain. You chop some vegetables. Then during the week, you combine
          them differently each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monday: chicken + rice + teriyaki sauce = teriyaki bowl. Tuesday:
          same chicken + tortilla + salsa + cheese = chicken wrap. Wednesday:
          chicken + pasta + pesto = chicken pesto pasta. Same base ingredients,
          three completely different meals. That&apos;s the move.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* The 1-hour Sunday system */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The 1-Hour Sunday System
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          This is the entire system. One hour. Four tasks. Everything runs in
          parallel, so you&apos;re not standing around waiting.
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Cook Protein #1 (0:00-0:45).</strong> Put 2-3 lbs of
            chicken thighs on a sheet pan. Season with salt, pepper, garlic
            powder. Into the oven at 400&deg;F for 35-40 minutes. Walk away.
            This is your main protein for the week &mdash; it goes in bowls,
            wraps, pasta, salads, everything.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook Protein #2 (0:00-0:15).</strong> While the chicken is
            in the oven, brown 1 lb of ground beef or turkey in a skillet. Season
            with whatever you want &mdash; taco seasoning for Mexican week, soy
            sauce and ginger for Asian week, Italian seasoning for pasta week.
            Takes 10-12 minutes. Now you have two different proteins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook one grain (0:05-0:25).</strong> Start a pot of rice or
            boil pasta while the proteins cook. Rice takes 20 minutes. Pasta
            takes 10. Either way, it&apos;s done before the chicken comes out
            of the oven. Make more than you think you need &mdash; cold rice
            makes the best fried rice, and leftover pasta is tomorrow&apos;s
            lunch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chop vegetables (0:15-0:30).</strong> While everything cooks,
            chop whatever vegetables you bought: bell peppers, onions, cucumbers,
            carrots. Put them in containers. These go into bowls, wraps, and
            stir-fries during the week. If you bought frozen vegetables instead
            (no judgment, they&apos;re great), skip this step entirely.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          That&apos;s it. By the time the chicken comes out of the oven, you
          have two proteins, one grain, and chopped vegetables ready to go.
          Everything goes into containers in the fridge. Total active time:
          about 45-60 minutes, mostly hands-off.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Mix and match bowls */}

        Mix-and-Match Bowls: Same Ingredients, Different Meals
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s where the magic happens. You prepped chicken, ground
          beef, rice, and vegetables. Now watch how many different meals that
          becomes:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Teriyaki bowl:</strong> Rice + chicken + veggies + teriyaki
            sauce + sesame seeds
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Burrito bowl:</strong> Rice + ground beef + salsa + cheese +
            sour cream + hot sauce
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chicken wrap:</strong> Tortilla + chicken + veggies + ranch
            or hummus
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taco night:</strong> Tortillas + ground beef + cheese +
            lettuce + salsa (5 minute dinner)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fried rice:</strong> Cold rice + egg + soy sauce + frozen
            veggies + whatever protein
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pasta bowl:</strong> Leftover rice swapped for pasta +
            chicken + pesto or marinara
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stir-fry:</strong> Any protein + veggies + soy sauce +
            sriracha, served over rice
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Seven different meals from the same prep session. The only thing that
          changes is the sauce and the combination. Buy 3-4 sauces (soy sauce,
          salsa, pesto, teriyaki) and you&apos;ll never eat the same meal twice
          in a week.
        </p>

      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          You don&apos;t need a $60 set of matching glass containers with
          color-coded lids. Here&apos;s what you actually need:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>8-10 basic containers with lids.</strong> Plastic is fine.
            Glass is nice but not necessary. Get them from the dollar store, a
            10-pack from Amazon, or just reuse takeout containers. Literally does
            not matter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A few gallon zip-lock bags.</strong> For storing chopped
            vegetables, marinating meat, or freezing extra portions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>That&apos;s it.</strong> No bento boxes. No compartmentalized
            meal prep containers. No vacuum sealer. Those are upgrades for later
            if you want them. For now, any container with a lid works.

        What NOT to Prep (Learn From Our Mistakes)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Some foods do not survive the fridge. Prepping them is a waste of time
          and ingredients. Avoid:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Dressed salads.</strong> Lettuce + dressing = soggy mush by
            day 2. Prep the ingredients separately and dress it right before
            eating.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fish.</strong> Cooked fish starts tasting &quot;fishy&quot;
            after one day in the fridge. Cook fish fresh or not at all.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anything with avocado.</strong> It browns in hours. Add
            avocado at serving time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Crispy foods.</strong> Fried anything, crispy chicken, toast
            &mdash; they all get soggy when stored. Crunch doesn&apos;t survive
            the container.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eggs (scrambled).</strong> Reheated scrambled eggs have a
            texture that can only be described as &quot;wrong.&quot; Hard-boiled
            eggs, however, prep beautifully.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The general rule: if a food&apos;s quality depends on texture (crunch,
          crispiness, freshness), don&apos;t prep it. If its quality depends on
          flavor (marinades, sauces, seasoned proteins), it actually gets
          <em> better</em> after a day in the fridge as flavors meld.

        How to Actually Stick With It
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The reason most people quit meal prep isn&apos;t that it&apos;s hard.
          It&apos;s that they try to do too much on day one. Here&apos;s how to
          make it stick:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Start with just dinners.</strong> Don&apos;t try to prep 21
            meals your first week. Prep enough for 4-5 dinners. If that goes
            well, add lunches the following week. Gradual &gt; ambitious.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pick the same day every week.</strong> Sunday works for most
            people, but any day is fine. The habit matters more than the day. Put
            it in your calendar like an appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Give yourself permission to be imperfect.</strong> Some weeks
            you won&apos;t feel like prepping. That&apos;s fine. Even prepping
            one protein and one grain is better than nothing. Two prepped
            components = 3-4 easy meals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Change your sauces every week.</strong> This week: teriyaki
            and salsa. Next week: pesto and curry. Same prep routine, completely
            different flavors. This is what keeps it from feeling repetitive.
          </li>
