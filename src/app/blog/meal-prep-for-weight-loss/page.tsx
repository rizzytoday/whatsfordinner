        <p>
          The problem isn&apos;t willpower &mdash; it&apos;s 6pm with no plan. When
          you&apos;re hungry and there&apos;s nothing ready, you eat whatever&apos;s
          fastest. A drive-through combo. Leftover pizza. Cereal straight from the
          box. Not because you lack discipline, but because your brain is tired and
          the path of least resistance wins.

        <p>
          Meal prep for weight loss fails for predictable reasons. Avoid these and
          you&apos;ll actually stick with it:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Going too restrictive.</strong> A 1,000-calorie day sounds
            productive until you&apos;re face-first in a bag of chips by Wednesday.
            Aim for a moderate deficit &mdash; 300-500 calories below maintenance.
            Sustainable beats aggressive every time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eating the same meal 5 days straight.</strong> Chicken and rice
            is fine on Monday. By Thursday it&apos;s punishment. Prep 2-3 different
            meals and rotate. Variety is what keeps you from abandoning the whole
            system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Forgetting about flavor.</strong> Low calorie doesn&apos;t mean
            low flavor. Use spices, citrus, fresh herbs, hot sauce, soy sauce. A
            well-seasoned 400-calorie meal is more satisfying than a bland
            600-calorie one.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepping 7 days at once.</strong> Food quality drops after day 4.
            Prep for 4 days, then do a quick 30-minute mid-week refresh &mdash; or
            freeze the last 2-3 days and thaw overnight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Skipping protein.</strong> Protein keeps you full longer than
            carbs or fat. Every meal should have at least 20-25g. Without it,
            you&apos;ll be hungry between meals and snack your way past your calorie
            goal.
