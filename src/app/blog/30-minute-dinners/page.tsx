        5. The 30-Minute Kitchen Setup
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The difference between a 30-minute meal and a 45-minute meal
          usually isn&apos;t the recipe. It&apos;s the 15 minutes you spend
          hunting for the garlic press, realizing you&apos;re out of olive
          oil, and rummaging through the spice drawer. Here&apos;s how to
          actually hit 30 minutes consistently:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Mise en place is non-negotiable.</strong> Read the recipe
            once. Pull everything out. Chop everything before you turn on the
            stove. This feels slower but it&apos;s dramatically faster because
            nothing burns while you&apos;re mid-dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Own a 12-inch skillet.</strong> Stainless steel or cast
            iron &mdash; either works. A large skillet means food isn&apos;t
            crowded, which means it sears instead of steaming. This single
            upgrade makes every one-pan meal better.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep a sheet pan ready.</strong> Line it with parchment
            or foil so cleanup is instant. Preheat the oven first &mdash; by
            the time you&apos;re done prepping, it&apos;s at temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Batch-prep aromatics on Sunday.</strong> Mince a full
            head of garlic, dice two onions, peel and grate a knob of ginger.
            Store in small containers in the fridge. This saves 5&ndash;8
            minutes on every weeknight meal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stock three sauces.</strong> Soy sauce, a good hot sauce,
            and something acidic (lemon juice or rice vinegar). These three
            bottles turn bland food into craveable food in seconds.
          </li>
        </ul>
