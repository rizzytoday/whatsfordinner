      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The meal planning app landscape looks completely different than it did
          two years ago. Legacy services like PlateJoy and Yummly have shut
          down. Others, like Mealime and Prepear, have stagnated. Meanwhile, a
          new wave of AI-powered planners has emerged &mdash; apps that generate
          personalized plans from scratch instead of shuffling the same recipe
          database.
        </p>
        <p>
          We tested every major meal planning app still active in 2026 to find
          out which ones actually save you time, which ones are worth paying
          for, and which ones are coasting on outdated tech. Here&apos;s what we
          found. New to meal planning? Start with our{" "}

        How we ranked these apps
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Every app on this list was evaluated against five criteria:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Personalization</strong> &mdash; Does it adapt to your
            dietary needs, allergies, household size, and taste preferences?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Price</strong> &mdash; Is the value there for what you get?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ease of use</strong> &mdash; Can you go from signup to meal
            plan in under five minutes?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dietary support</strong> &mdash; How well does it handle
            restrictions like keto, vegan, low-FODMAP, or custom diets?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automation</strong> &mdash; Does it do the work for you, or
            are you still dragging recipes around a calendar?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Apps that require manual effort to build plans scored lower than those
          that generate everything automatically. In 2026, you shouldn&apos;t
          have to plan your planner.

        1. What&apos;s For Dinner &mdash; Best overall
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          What&apos;s For Dinner uses Claude AI to generate fully personalized
          weekly meal plans with a grocery list, delivered straight to your
          inbox. No app to download, no recipes to browse, no calendar to
          manage. You set your preferences once &mdash; dietary restrictions,
          allergies, cuisine preferences, household size, budget tier &mdash;
          and a new plan shows up every week.
        </p>
        <p>
          What sets it apart from every other app on this list is genuine
          intelligence. The AI doesn&apos;t pull from a fixed recipe database.
          It generates original meal plans tailored to your exact constraints,
          every single week, without repeating itself. If you tell it you&apos;re
          pescatarian, hate cilantro, feed a family of four on a budget, and
          prefer Mediterranean and Japanese food &mdash; that&apos;s exactly
          what you get.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <strong>$7.99/month</strong>, it&apos;s also the cheapest serious
          option on this list. There&apos;s a free trial that requires no
          signup and no credit card.

        2. Mealime &mdash; Best free option
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Mealime has been around since 2015 and remains one of the most
          downloaded meal planning apps, largely because its core features are
          free. You pick recipes from their library, it generates a grocery
          list, and the step-by-step cooking instructions are genuinely well
          done. For someone who enjoys browsing recipes and building their own
          plan, it&apos;s solid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is variety. Mealime&apos;s recipe library hasn&apos;t
          grown much in recent years, and free users hit the repetition wall
          fast. After a few weeks, you&apos;re cycling through the same
          meals. The Pro version ($5.99/mo) unlocks more recipes and
          nutritional info, but the core issue remains: you&apos;re still
          picking meals manually from a static database.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want a free starting point and don&apos;t mind doing the
          planning yourself, Mealime works. If you want the planning done for
          you, it falls short.

        3. Eat This Much &mdash; Best for calorie counters
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Eat This Much is the go-to if your primary goal is hitting specific
          macronutrient targets. You set your calorie goal, macro split, and
          dietary preferences, and it auto-generates daily meal plans to match.
          For bodybuilders, people on strict medical diets, or anyone who
          thinks in grams of protein, it&apos;s genuinely useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trade-off is taste. Eat This Much optimizes for numbers, not for
          meals you&apos;d actually look forward to eating. Plans can feel
          robotic &mdash; think &ldquo;4 oz chicken breast, 1 cup brown rice,
          steamed broccoli&rdquo; repeated with slight variations. It&apos;s
          functional, but it&apos;s not inspiring. The premium tier ($9/mo)
          adds grocery lists and more customization, but the meal quality
          issue persists.

        4. eMeals &mdash; Best store integration
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          eMeals has been in the meal planning space since 2003, making it one
          of the oldest players still standing. Its strongest feature is
          grocery store integration &mdash; you can send your shopping list
          directly to Walmart, Kroger, Instacart, or Amazon Fresh with one
          tap. For people who want a seamless plan-to-purchase pipeline,
          that&apos;s a real time-saver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where eMeals falls flat is personalization. Plans are organized by
          broad categories (Quick &amp; Healthy, Kid-Friendly, Low-Carb) rather
          than tailored to your specific needs. You&apos;re choosing a plan
          type, not describing your household. If you have niche dietary
          requirements or want plans that evolve with your feedback, eMeals
          feels generic. Pricing starts at $5.99/mo.

        <p>
          Plan to Eat isn&apos;t really a meal planner &mdash; it&apos;s a
          recipe organizer with a calendar. You import recipes from any
          website using their browser extension, tag and categorize them, then
          drag them onto a weekly calendar. It generates a grocery list from
          whatever you&apos;ve planned. If you already have a collection of
          recipes you love and just need a way to organize them, Plan to Eat
          does that well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The downside is that it does absolutely nothing for you. There&apos;s
          no suggestion engine, no personalization, no automation. You are the
          planner. For people who enjoy that process, it&apos;s great. For
          everyone else, it&apos;s just a fancy calendar. At $5.95/mo, you&apos;re
          paying for organization, not intelligence.

      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Prepear connects you to recipes from popular food bloggers and lets
          you plan meals from their content. If you follow food blogs and want
          a central place to organize recipes from your favorite creators,
          Prepear&apos;s model makes sense. The app is free with a premium
          tier ($7.99/mo) that adds grocery lists and family sharing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quality issue is real, though. Because recipes come from
          independent bloggers, there&apos;s no consistency in nutritional
          accuracy, ingredient availability, or difficulty level. One
          blogger&apos;s &ldquo;easy weeknight dinner&rdquo; might require
          specialty ingredients and 90 minutes of prep. There&apos;s no AI
          filtering or personalization beyond basic categories, so you&apos;re
          still doing the heavy lifting.

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Paprika is a beloved recipe manager that&apos;s been around for over
          a decade. It clips recipes from the web, strips out the blog fluff,
          and gives you clean, readable recipe cards. It also has a meal
          planner calendar and grocery list feature. The app is a one-time
          purchase ($4.99 per platform) rather than a subscription, which
          appeals to people who hate recurring charges.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Paprika is a recipe <em>manager</em>, not a meal{" "}
          <em>planner</em>. It stores and organizes what you already have. It
          doesn&apos;t suggest meals, adapt to your diet, or generate plans.
          You&apos;re still deciding what to cook every week. For power users
          who have hundreds of saved recipes and want a clean interface to
          manage them, Paprika is excellent. For people who want the thinking
          done for them, it&apos;s the wrong tool.

        <p>
          Budget Bytes isn&apos;t an app &mdash; it&apos;s a recipe website
          with a meal planning add-on. The site has been a go-to resource for
          budget-conscious cooks since 2009, with every recipe showing a
          per-serving cost breakdown. The content is genuinely excellent:
          affordable meals that actually taste good, with clear instructions
          and honest pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meal planning feature (Budget Bytes Meal Plans, $8/mo) gives you
          weekly plans built from their recipe library. But it&apos;s not
          personalized &mdash; everyone gets the same plan. There are no
          dietary filters, no allergy support, and no way to customize beyond

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Cooklist takes a different approach: instead of starting with
          recipes, it starts with what&apos;s already in your kitchen. You
          scan grocery receipts or manually log ingredients, and the app
          suggests recipes based on what you have on hand. It also tracks
          expiration dates to help reduce food waste. The concept is smart, and
          the pantry tracking is well-executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a meal planner, though, Cooklist is weak. Suggestions are limited
          to what matches your pantry, which often means incomplete or
          uninspiring meals. There&apos;s no weekly planning, no dietary
          personalization, and no grocery list generation for things you need
          to buy. It solves the &ldquo;what can I make tonight&rdquo; question
          but doesn&apos;t help with the bigger picture of planning a full

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          HelloFresh is the elephant in the room. It&apos;s not a meal
          planning app &mdash; it&apos;s a meal kit delivery service. You
          choose recipes, and pre-portioned ingredients show up at your door
          with step-by-step recipe cards. For people who want zero grocery
          shopping and minimal prep, it&apos;s the most hands-off option on
          this list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cost is the dealbreaker. HelloFresh runs $8-12 per serving,
          which means a family of four is spending $200-400+ per week on
          dinners alone. Compare that to a meal planning app that costs $8/mo
          and helps you shop at your local grocery store for a fraction of the
          price. HelloFresh is convenient, but it&apos;s a luxury, not a
          solution for everyday meal planning on a normal budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          HelloFresh also offers limited dietary customization. You can filter
          by broad categories (veggie, calorie-smart, fit &amp; wholesome) but
          can&apos;t specify allergies, restrictions, or cuisine preferences
          with any precision.

          The pattern in this list is hard to miss. The older apps &mdash;
          recipe databases, manual calendars, static plan libraries &mdash;
          are all struggling with the same problem: they can&apos;t
          personalize at scale. Building a meal plan that accounts for your
          diet, allergies, budget, taste preferences, household size, and
          cooking skill requires either a massive content operation or
          artificial intelligence. The content approach doesn&apos;t scale.
          AI does.

          That&apos;s why services like PlateJoy and Yummly shut down. They

          generates plans from scratch in seconds, handles any dietary
          restriction described in plain English, and never runs out of
          variety. The economics are completely different, which is why AI
          planners can charge $8/mo instead of $10+. We compare the two
          approaches in detail in our{" "}

          The apps that survive the next few years will be the ones that
          embrace this shift. The ones clinging to static recipe databases
          are running on borrowed time.
