        ADHD Meal Planning: Because Regular Systems Don&apos;t Work for You
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          You&apos;ve tried meal planning. You bought the containers. You
          prepped on Sunday. You felt great about it for exactly 48 hours.
          By Wednesday, the chicken sat untouched in the fridge, the
          vegetables were wilting, and you ordered Thai food because the
          thought of following the plan made you want to crawl under a
          blanket.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn&apos;t a discipline problem. It&apos;s not a motivation
          problem. Traditional meal planning requires sustained executive
          function &mdash; the exact thing ADHD brains struggle with. Choosing
          21 meals in advance, sequencing prep steps, estimating cook times,
          remembering what you planned, and then actually wanting to eat it
          three days later &mdash; that&apos;s an executive function marathon
          disguised as a simple life hack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here&apos;s a system that actually accounts for how your brain
          works. It&apos;s not about trying harder. It&apos;s about building
          a structure that doesn&apos;t fight your wiring.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Why regular meal planning fails */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Why Regular Meal Planning Fails with ADHD
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          It helps to understand exactly why the traditional approach
          breaks down. It&apos;s not random &mdash; there are specific
          cognitive demands that collide with how ADHD brains process
          information:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Decision fatigue.</strong> Choosing 21 meals for the week
            is overwhelming before you even start. Your brain stalls at the
            sheer number of options, and &quot;I&apos;ll figure it out
            later&quot; becomes the default. Then later never comes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time blindness.</strong> That recipe that says &quot;30
            minutes&quot; takes you 50 because you forgot to defrost the
            chicken, couldn&apos;t find the cumin, and got distracted
            midway through chopping onions. Every meal takes longer than
            planned, which makes the whole system feel like it&apos;s
            failing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interest-based motivation.</strong> Neurotypical brains
            can eat something boring because it&apos;s practical. ADHD brains
            can&apos;t force themselves to eat Tuesday&apos;s planned grilled
            chicken when every fiber of their being wants something else.
            You&apos;re not being difficult &mdash; your motivation system
            literally runs on interest, novelty, and urgency, not
            schedules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Working memory.</strong> You planned meals on Sunday. By
            Tuesday, you&apos;ve forgotten what you planned. The list is
            somewhere &mdash; in a notebook, an app, a screenshot you took
            &mdash; but finding it is its own task, and now the activation
            energy to cook has doubled.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>All-or-nothing thinking.</strong> You missed one day of
            the plan, so the whole week feels ruined. Instead of just picking
            it back up, you abandon it entirely. The plan becomes evidence
            that you can&apos;t do this, which makes it harder to try again.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          None of these are character flaws. They&apos;re features of a brain
          that works differently. The solution isn&apos;t to try harder at
          the neurotypical system &mdash; it&apos;s to build a different
          system entirely.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* The flexible framework */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The Flexible Framework
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Instead of planning specific meals for specific days, plan
          <strong> categories</strong>. This gives you structure without
          rigidity &mdash; a framework your ADHD brain can work within
          instead of against.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-stone-50 rounded-2xl p-6 my-4">

              <span className="font-medium text-stone-700 w-24 shrink-0">Weekend</span>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Within each category, you decide day-of based on what actually
          sounds good. Monday is pasta night, but whether it&apos;s penne
          with marinara or mac and cheese or ramen noodles with soy sauce
          &mdash; that&apos;s up to present-you, not past-you who made the
          plan on Sunday and had completely different cravings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This works for ADHD brains because it reduces decisions without
          removing all choice. You&apos;re not choosing from infinite options
          (paralyzing) or following a rigid script (suffocating). You&apos;re
          choosing within a small, manageable box. The category narrows the
          field enough that your brain can actually pick something.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if Thursday rolls around and you absolutely do not want
          stir-fry? Swap it with another night. Or eat cereal. The framework
          is a suggestion, not a contract.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Keep It Stupid Simple
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The fastest way to kill an ADHD meal plan is complexity. The more
          steps, the more ingredients, the more things that can go wrong or
          get forgotten. Here are the rules:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li><strong>Maximum 5 ingredients per meal.</strong> Not counting oil, salt, and pepper. If it needs more than 5 things, it&apos;s too complicated for a weeknight.</li>
          <li><strong>Maximum 20 minutes.</strong> Including prep. If the recipe says 20 but you know it&apos;ll take you 35, it&apos;s not a 20-minute meal for you. Be honest about your time.</li>
          <li><strong>One pan or one pot.</strong> Multiple pans running simultaneously is a recipe for burned food, forgotten side dishes, and sensory overwhelm.</li>
          <li><strong>6 steps or fewer.</strong> If the recipe has a paragraph for each step and a dozen sub-steps, close the tab. You need recipes that fit on one phone screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This isn&apos;t about being a bad cook. Some of the best food in
          the world is simple &mdash; pasta aglio e olio is four ingredients
          and it&apos;s a classic for a reason. Simplicity isn&apos;t settling.
          It&apos;s strategic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is meals you can make on autopilot, even on days when your
          brain is running 47 background processes and none of them are about
          dinner.
        </p>
      </div>

      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Forget buying exact ingredients for exact recipes. That requires
          you to (1) remember the recipes, (2) look up each one, (3)
          cross-reference ingredients, and (4) combine them into a list.
          That&apos;s four executive function steps before you even leave
          the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, buy <strong>versatile staples</strong> that work across
          multiple meal categories:

          With these staples, you can make pasta with sauce, a rice bowl, a
          quesadilla, a stir-fry, a wrap, scrambled eggs, or a grain bowl
          &mdash; all without needing a specific recipe. The ingredients
          cross-pollinate between categories, so nothing goes to waste even
          if you skip a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>And always have backup frozen meals.</strong> Frozen
          pizzas, frozen burritos, frozen dumplings &mdash; whatever you
          like. These are not plan failures. They&apos;re plan B, and
          plan B is part of the plan. Because the plan will fall apart
          sometimes, and having a 3-minute backup means &quot;plan fell
          apart&quot; doesn&apos;t have to mean &quot;skipped dinner.&quot;

          Here&apos;s an honest assessment of the framework above: it&apos;s
          better than traditional meal planning for ADHD, but it still
          requires you to go grocery shopping, remember what categories you
          planned, and actually make the food. On good weeks, that&apos;s
          doable. On bad weeks, even &quot;bowl night&quot; is too many

          You set your preferences once and a fresh plan arrives every week.
          No browsing recipes. No cross-referencing ingredients. No Sunday
          planning sessions that take 45 minutes and drain your executive
          function before the week even starts.

          people you&apos;re feeding, and what your budget is. It handles
          everything else. For ADHD brains, outsourcing the executive
          function of eating is one of the highest-value things you can do
          for yourself.

        When the Plan Falls Apart (and It Will)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Let&apos;s be honest about this: no meal planning system works
          perfectly every week. Not for anyone, and especially not with
          ADHD. There will be weeks where you follow the plan beautifully
          and weeks where the groceries rot and you eat cereal for three
          days straight. Both of these are fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the plan falls apart, here&apos;s what to do:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li><strong>Don&apos;t spiral.</strong> One bad day is not a failed week. One bad week is not a failed system. It&apos;s just a week. Next week exists.</li>
          <li><strong>Eat the frozen pizza.</strong> That&apos;s why it&apos;s there. It&apos;s not a consolation prize, it&apos;s the backup plan doing its job.</li>
          <li><strong>Don&apos;t guilt-shop.</strong> Resist the urge to buy a bunch of fresh produce to &quot;make up for it&quot; &mdash; you&apos;ll waste it and feel worse.</li>
          <li><strong>Lower the bar.</strong> If following a meal plan feels impossible right now, aim for &quot;I ate something today.&quot; That&apos;s the new bar. You can raise it when things feel more stable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal of ADHD meal planning is not perfection. It&apos;s eating
          slightly better than you would with no system at all. If having a
          loose framework means you cook three nights instead of zero, that&apos;s
          three more home-cooked meals than you would have had. That&apos;s not
          failure &mdash; that&apos;s progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          And on the nights you can&apos;t cook, the{" "}

          are always there. Yogurt and granola is a real meal. Cereal is a
          real meal. You eating something is always better than you eating
          nothing.
