        Why Your Groceries Keep Going Bad (The Fix Is Simple)
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          You know the cycle. You go grocery shopping on Sunday with the best intentions.
          You buy fresh vegetables, lean protein, fruit, salad greens. You feel good about
          yourself. You&apos;re going to cook this week. This is the week it all changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monday you&apos;re tired. Tuesday you forgot to thaw the chicken. Wednesday
          you order Thai food. Thursday you open the fridge and the spinach is slimy,
          the chicken smells questionable, and the bell pepper has a soft spot. You throw
          it all away, feel guilty, and order delivery again. Friday you buy groceries
          again. The cycle continues.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn&apos;t a character flaw. It&apos;s not a discipline problem. It&apos;s
          a planning problem. And the fix is embarrassingly simple.
        </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The Grocery Guilt Cycle
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Let&apos;s name what&apos;s happening, because once you see it you can&apos;t
          unsee it:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li><strong>Buy with ambition.</strong> You&apos;re in the store, feeling healthy and motivated. You buy fresh produce, interesting ingredients, things you saw on a recipe video.</li>
          <li><strong>Reality hits.</strong> The week gets busy. You&apos;re tired after work. Some of those recipes look harder than you thought.</li>
          <li><strong>Food rots.</strong> By midweek, the perishables start going bad. The clock is ticking and you can feel it every time you open the fridge.</li>
          <li><strong>Feel guilty.</strong> You throw away food and money. You feel bad about the waste. You feel bad about &quot;failing&quot; at being an adult.</li>
          <li><strong>Order delivery.</strong> Out of guilt and hunger, you open DoorDash. Another $25-30 gone.</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat.</strong> Next Sunday, you&apos;re back at the store, swearing this week will be different.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This is the most expensive cycle in your budget. You&apos;re paying for
          groceries AND delivery. You&apos;re spending money twice to eat once.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Why it happens */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Why It Happens
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The root cause is almost always the same: <strong>no plan</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you shop without a meal plan, you buy based on vibes. &quot;That
          looks good.&quot; &quot;I should eat more vegetables.&quot; &quot;Maybe
          I&apos;ll make stir-fry this week.&quot; But &quot;maybe&quot; doesn&apos;t
          keep food from going bad. Only a concrete plan does.
        </p>
        <p>
          No plan means:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li><strong>Random buying.</strong> Ingredients that don&apos;t go together. A bell pepper with no recipe to put it in. Chicken with no plan for when you&apos;ll cook it.</li>
          <li><strong>Aspirational purchases.</strong> You buy what you <em>wish</em> you&apos;d eat, not what you <em>will</em> eat. That kale? The beets? The fresh ginger? They&apos;re going in the trash and we both know it.</li>
          <li><strong>No timeline.</strong> Perishables have deadlines. Fresh chicken: 1-2 days. Berries: 3-5 days. Salad greens: 3-4 days. If you don&apos;t know when you&apos;re using each ingredient, you&apos;re just hoping you beat the clock. You usually won&apos;t.</li>
          <li><strong>Duplicate buying.</strong> Without checking what you have, you buy a second bottle of soy sauce, more eggs when you already have a dozen, garlic when there&apos;s garlic in the drawer. Now you have double the perishables and the same amount of time.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      {/* The fix */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The Fix: Buy ONLY What You&apos;ll Cook
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          This is it. This is the entire fix. It&apos;s not a hack. It&apos;s not a
          system with 12 steps. It&apos;s one rule: <strong>have a plan before you
          shop</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not a vague idea. Not &quot;I&apos;ll probably make pasta and maybe some
          chicken thing.&quot; A real plan:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>Pick 4-5 meals for the week</li>
          <li>List every ingredient those meals need</li>
          <li>Check what you already have and cross it off</li>
          <li>Buy only what&apos;s left on the list</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          That&apos;s it. Every item in your cart has a specific meal attached to it.
          Nothing is aspirational. Nothing is &quot;maybe.&quot; Every bell pepper has
          a Wednesday dinner. Every chicken breast has a Tuesday recipe. Every ingredient
          earns its spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you shop this way, food waste drops dramatically because nothing is random.
          You&apos;re not buying produce that &quot;might&quot; get used. You&apos;re
          buying produce that <em>will</em> get used, because it&apos;s already assigned
          to a meal.
        </p>

          The pattern is clear: plan fresh/perishable meals for early in the week and
          pantry/frozen meals for later. Monday&apos;s dinner uses the fresh salmon.
          Thursday&apos;s dinner uses the frozen stir-fry vegetables and canned coconut
          milk. By the weekend, you&apos;re working from the pantry and freezer.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The &quot;Buy Less, More Often&quot; Approach
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          If the big Sunday haul keeps ending in waste, try a different rhythm: two
          smaller shopping trips instead of one big one.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Trip 1 (Sunday or Monday):</strong> Buy pantry staples, frozen
            items, hardy produce, and fresh protein/produce for the first 3-4 days of
            meals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trip 2 (Wednesday or Thursday):</strong> Buy fresh ingredients for
            the last 3 days. This is a quick trip &mdash; you already have the pantry
            base from trip 1.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This keeps produce fresh because you&apos;re never asking berries to survive
          a full week. The second trip is small and fast &mdash; maybe 5-6 items. It
          adds 15 minutes to your week but saves you from throwing away $15-20 in
          spoiled food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, lean hard into frozen and canned for your base and only buy
          fresh what you&apos;ll use within 3 days. Frozen vegetables are just as
          nutritious as fresh, last months, and never go bad on you. They&apos;re the
          most underrated grocery hack for people who hate food waste.

          Here&apos;s the honest truth: the reason most people waste groceries is because
          meal planning takes effort. And when something takes effort, it doesn&apos;t
          happen consistently. The first week? Great. The second week? Okay. Week three?

          means you walk into the store knowing exactly what to buy. Every item on the
          list maps to a specific meal. You don&apos;t browse. You don&apos;t guess. You
          don&apos;t buy aspirational kale. You buy what you need and you leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grocery list is the entire point. Without it, you&apos;re shopping blind.
          With it, you&apos;re shopping with purpose. Food waste drops. Spending drops.
          The guilt cycle breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          What&apos;s For Dinner generates a personalized weekly meal plan with recipes
          and a consolidated grocery list for $7.99/mo. You set your preferences once
          &mdash; dietary needs, household size, budget, cooking skill &mdash; and get a
          fresh plan delivered to your inbox every week. Every ingredient on the list
          has a meal. Nothing goes to waste.
