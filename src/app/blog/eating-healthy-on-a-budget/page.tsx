        Eating Healthy on a Budget: $50/Week, No Sad Salads
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Healthy eating has a marketing problem. Scroll through any wellness
          Instagram and you&apos;ll see $14 acai bowls, $12 cold-pressed juices,
          and grocery hauls from Whole Foods that cost more than rent. The
          message is clear: eating well is for people with money.
        </p>
        <p>
          That&apos;s nonsense. You can eat genuinely healthy &mdash; balanced
          meals with real protein, vegetables, and enough variety to not lose
          your mind &mdash; for about $50 a week. Not by eating plain rice and
          boiled chicken every day. Not by surviving on ramen and multivitamins.
          Actual food that tastes good and keeps you full.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn&apos;t a theoretical budget. Below is a specific grocery list
          with real prices, seven days of meals built from those ingredients, and
          the cooking tricks that make cheap food taste like you tried.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* The boring but works staples */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The &quot;Boring But Works&quot; Staples
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Before we get into the actual list, let&apos;s talk about the
          foundation. Every budget meal plan on earth is built on the same
          handful of ingredients. They&apos;re not glamorous. They&apos;re not
          going viral on TikTok. But they&apos;re cheap, nutritious, and
          ridiculously versatile:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Rice</strong> &mdash; $0.10/serving. Goes with literally
            everything. Stir-fry, bowls, burritos, fried rice, soup. A 5 lb bag
            lasts weeks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Oats</strong> &mdash; $0.12/serving. Breakfast is solved.
            Overnight oats, stovetop oatmeal, baked oats if you&apos;re feeling
            fancy. Add a banana and peanut butter and it&apos;s a complete meal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eggs</strong> &mdash; $0.25 each. The single best
            budget protein. Scrambled, fried, boiled, in fried rice, on toast,
            in ramen. A dozen eggs is a dozen meals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frozen vegetables</strong> &mdash; $1/bag. Broccoli, mixed
            veggies, stir-fry blends. They&apos;re flash-frozen at peak
            nutrition, last months, and cost a fraction of fresh. No shame in
            frozen veg. None.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chicken thighs</strong> &mdash; $2-3/lb. Not breasts.
            Thighs. They&apos;re cheaper, juicier, harder to overcook, and
            taste better. This is the hill we die on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Canned beans</strong> &mdash; $0.80/can. Black beans,
            chickpeas, kidney beans. Protein, fiber, and they bulk up any meal
            for under a dollar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bananas</strong> &mdash; $0.25 each. The cheapest fruit in
            any grocery store, every single time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Not exciting? Sure. But these seven ingredients cover protein, complex
          carbs, fiber, potassium, iron, and most of the vitamins you need. The
          trick is making them taste good, which we&apos;ll get to.
        </p>

        How to Make Cheap Food Taste Good (The Restaurant Secret)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s why restaurant food tastes better than yours: it&apos;s
          not the ingredients. It&apos;s three things &mdash; fat, acid, and
          seasoning. Every professional kitchen uses these three elements to
          make even the simplest dishes taste layered and complete. You can do
          the same thing for almost no money.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Fat.</strong> Butter, oil, cheese. Fat carries flavor and
            makes food feel satisfying. A tablespoon of butter in your rice. A
            drizzle of oil on your broccoli before you roast it. Cheese on top
            of literally anything. Fat is not the enemy &mdash; it&apos;s why
            your food tastes flat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Acid.</strong> Lime juice, vinegar, tomatoes. Acid cuts
            through richness and makes flavors pop. Squeeze lime on your tacos.
            Add a splash of vinegar to your stir-fry. Use canned tomatoes as a
            sauce base. If your food tastes &quot;fine but boring,&quot; it
            probably needs acid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Seasoning.</strong> Salt is obvious, but go beyond it. Soy
            sauce adds depth to anything with rice. Hot sauce transforms eggs.
            Garlic and onion are cheap and make everything smell like someone who
            knows how to cook lives here. You don&apos;t need 30 spices. You
            need salt, pepper, garlic powder, soy sauce, and hot sauce. That
            covers 90% of cuisines.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The difference between sad budget food and delicious budget food
          is about $3 worth of condiments and 30 seconds of effort. Toast your
          spices in the pan before adding ingredients. Brown your onions until
          they&apos;re golden, not just translucent. Finish with a squeeze of
          lime. These tiny steps cost nothing and change everything.

        Budget Shopping Strategies That Actually Work
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Beyond the specific list above, here are the rules that keep grocery
          bills low week after week:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Never shop hungry.</strong> This sounds like advice from
            your mom, and she was right. Hungry shopping adds $15-20 of impulse
            buys every single trip.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Buy frozen vegetables, not fresh.</strong> Fresh broccoli
            goes bad in 4 days. Frozen broccoli lasts 6 months, costs less, and
            has the same nutritional value. The only fresh produce worth buying
            on a budget are onions, garlic, bananas, and whatever&apos;s on sale.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chicken thighs over breasts, always.</strong> Thighs are
            $2-3/lb vs $4-5/lb for breasts. They&apos;re more forgiving to
            cook, have more flavor, and stay moist even if you overcook them
            slightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Store brand everything.</strong> Store brand canned beans,
            pasta, rice, oats, and frozen vegetables are the exact same product
            as name brands. The savings are 20-40% on every item.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shop with a list.</strong> People who shop from a{" "}

            spend 25% less than those who wing it. That&apos;s not a motivational
            stat &mdash; it&apos;s basic math. A list means no wandering, no
            &quot;oh that looks good,&quot; no buying things you already have.

          Some &quot;healthy&quot; foods are terrible value. They&apos;re
          marketed as smart choices but cost 5-10x more than equally nutritious
          alternatives:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-cut fruit and vegetables.</strong> A whole pineapple is
            $3. Pre-cut pineapple chunks are $7. You&apos;re paying $4 for
            someone to use a knife. Same with baby carrots vs regular carrots,
            pre-sliced mushrooms, bagged salad mixes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protein bars and shakes.</strong> A protein bar costs $2-3.
            Two eggs cost $0.50 and have more protein. Unless you literally
            cannot eat real food, skip the bars.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organic everything.</strong> Organic chicken thighs are
            $6/lb vs $2/lb conventional. For most produce, the nutritional
            difference is negligible. If budget is tight, conventional is fine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Specialty health food.</strong> Quinoa ($5/lb) vs rice
            ($0.80/lb). Almond milk ($4) vs regular milk ($3). Avocado oil ($8)
            vs canola oil ($3). The expensive options aren&apos;t 6x healthier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>&quot;Healthy&quot; frozen meals.</strong> A Lean Cuisine is
            $4 for 300 calories that won&apos;t fill you up. For $4 you can
            make a chicken thigh with rice and broccoli that&apos;s 600+
            calories of actual food.

          Let&apos;s be honest: $50/week is tight. It works for one person
          who&apos;s willing to cook every meal and eat simple food. If
          you&apos;re feeding two people, double the proteins and produce

          If you have $70-80/week to work with, add these upgrades in order of
          impact: fresh fruit beyond bananas ($3), yogurt ($4), ground beef or
          pork ($5), bread ($3), and more variety of frozen vegetables ($3).
          Each addition adds meal variety without breaking the budget.
