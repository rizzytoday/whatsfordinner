        Food Budget in Your 20s: How Much Should You Actually Spend?
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Nobody teaches you how much to spend on food. There&apos;s no class
          for it. Your parents either cooked and you had no idea what groceries
          cost, or they didn&apos;t cook and you grew up thinking $15 Chipotle
          runs were just how dinner worked. Then you move out and suddenly
          you&apos;re spending $800 a month on food with absolutely no idea
          how it happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here&apos;s the thing &mdash; food is probably your biggest budget
          leak. Not rent (that&apos;s fixed). Not utilities (also mostly fixed).
          Food is the one major expense that varies wildly based on your habits,
          and most people in their 20s have no system for controlling it. You
          buy groceries. Half of them go bad. You order delivery. You grab
          coffee. You go out with friends. None of it feels expensive in the
          moment, and then your bank statement arrives and you wonder if
          someone stole your debit card.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&apos;s fix this. No spreadsheet gymnastics, no guilt trips about
          your morning coffee. Just a realistic framework for how much you
          should spend, where the money actually goes, and one habit that makes
          the whole thing stick.

        What the Average 20-Something Actually Spends
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          According to USDA data and consumer spending surveys, the average
          single adult in their 20s spends $300 to $500 per month on food.
          That&apos;s the &quot;moderate&quot; plan. But here&apos;s where it
          gets interesting &mdash; that number is just the average. When you
          break it down by category, you see where the money really goes:

          </table>
        </div>
        <p>
          See the problem? It&apos;s not groceries. Most people&apos;s grocery
          spending is reasonable. It&apos;s the delivery apps and casual dining
          out that blow the budget. A $25 DoorDash order five times a week is
          $500 a month all by itself &mdash; more than most people&apos;s
          entire grocery budget. (If that number looks familiar, read our{" "}
          <Link

          .)
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;high end&quot; column is where a lot of 20-somethings
          actually live, even if they don&apos;t realize it. Adding it up
          across delivery, dining, groceries, and coffee &mdash; $800 to
          $1,000 per month on food is more common than you&apos;d think.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* What you SHOULD spend */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        What You Should Actually Spend
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s a realistic target for one person in their 20s:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Groceries:</strong> $200 to $300 per month ($50 to $75
            per week)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dining out + delivery:</strong> $50 to $100 per month
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Coffee/drinks:</strong> $20 to $40 per month
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Total target:</strong> $250 to $400 per month
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Is this tight? A little. Is it doable? Absolutely. People all over
          the country feed themselves well on $300 a month. The difference
          between them and the people spending $800 isn&apos;t willpower or
          cooking talent &mdash; it&apos;s having a system. Specifically, a
          meal plan and a grocery list.
        </p>
        <p>
          At $300 per month on groceries, that&apos;s about $75 per week.
          A week of groceries for one person &mdash; chicken, rice, pasta,
          vegetables, eggs, cheese, bread, and a few extras &mdash; easily
          fits in that budget. It&apos;s when you don&apos;t have a list and
          wander the store buying whatever looks good (plus the stuff you
          forgot and came back for on Wednesday) that costs balloon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dining out budget isn&apos;t zero. That&apos;s important.
          Going out with friends is part of being in your 20s. The goal
          isn&apos;t to become a hermit &mdash; it&apos;s to make eating out
          a conscious choice instead of a default.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* The 70/30 rule */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The 70/30 Rule
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          If percentages are easier to remember than dollar amounts, use
          the 70/30 rule: <strong>cook 70% of your meals, eat out 30%</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, that looks like this:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Cook 5 dinners per week</strong> at home
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eat out 2 dinners per week</strong> (Friday date night,
            Saturday with friends)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pack lunch</strong> most weekdays (leftovers from the
            night before)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Breakfast at home</strong> (oatmeal, eggs, smoothie,
            whatever is fast)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This ratio is sustainable because it doesn&apos;t feel like
          punishment. You&apos;re still going out. You&apos;re still being
          social. You&apos;re just not doing it seven nights a week. Most
          people who try the 70/30 rule save $200 to $400 per month without
          feeling deprived.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key insight: cooking 5 dinners per week sounds like a lot, but
          it&apos;s not when you have a plan. Without a plan, every cooking
          night is a separate decision that takes energy. With a plan, it&apos;s
          just execution &mdash; the decision was already made on Sunday.

        How to Track Without Being Obsessive
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Nobody wants to log every purchase in a spreadsheet. You won&apos;t
          do it, and even if you do, you&apos;ll stop after two weeks. Here
          are three tracking methods that actually work for normal humans:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>The cash method.</strong> Withdraw your weekly food budget
            in cash on Sunday. Put it in an envelope (or just your wallet).
            When it&apos;s gone, it&apos;s gone &mdash; you cook with
            what&apos;s in the pantry. This is the most effective method
            because it creates a physical constraint. You can&apos;t
            accidentally overspend if there&apos;s no cash left.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The one-check method.</strong> Once a month, open your
            bank app and filter transactions by food-related categories.
            Add them up. That&apos;s it. You don&apos;t need daily tracking
            &mdash; a monthly check-in shows you the trend. If you&apos;re
            over budget, you know what to adjust next month.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The separate card method.</strong> Use one debit card
            (or a prepaid card) exclusively for food. Load it with your
            monthly food budget. When the balance gets low, you know to
            rein it in. No logging required &mdash; the balance IS the
            tracking.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Pick one. Any one. The best budgeting system is the one you&apos;ll
          actually use, not the most comprehensive one. You don&apos;t need
          to track to the penny. You just need to know roughly where you
          stand and catch yourself before a $800 month happens.
        </p>

            meal planning
          </Link>{" "}
          is the single most effective way to control food spending. Here&apos;s
          why it works so well:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>No impulse grocery purchases.</strong> When you shop from
            a list, you buy what you need and nothing else. No wandering, no
            &quot;that looks good,&quot; no $7 artisanal crackers you&apos;ll
            eat twice and forget about.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No food waste.</strong> Americans throw away 30 to 40% of
            the food they buy. When every ingredient in your fridge has a
            purpose &mdash; it&apos;s going into a specific meal this week &mdash;
            nothing rots in the back of the crisper drawer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No delivery impulse.</strong> The #1 reason people order
            delivery is &quot;I don&apos;t know what to eat and there&apos;s
            nothing in the fridge.&quot; A meal plan eliminates both. Dinner is
            decided. Groceries are there. DoorDash doesn&apos;t even cross
            your mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatic budget discipline.</strong> When your grocery list
