          Eat This Much has been around for a while, and the idea behind it is
          solid: tell the app your calorie and macro goals, and it spits out a
          meal plan. Simple. Automatic. No thinking required.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you&apos;ve used it for more than a couple of weeks, you&apos;ve
          probably noticed the cracks. The same meals showing up over and over.
          Recipes that feel more like spreadsheet output than something you&apos;d
          actually want to cook. A UI that hasn&apos;t meaningfully changed in
          years. And a free tier so limited it barely counts as a trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;re looking for something better &mdash; something that
          generates meals you&apos;re genuinely excited to eat &mdash;{" "}
          <strong>What&apos;s For Dinner</strong> might be exactly what
          you&apos;re after. It uses AI to create original, personalized meal
          plans every week, delivered straight to your inbox at half the price.

        What is Eat This Much?
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Eat This Much is an automatic meal planner that builds daily and weekly
          meal plans based on your calorie targets, macronutrient ratios, and
          dietary preferences. It pulls from an internal recipe database and
          tries to assemble combinations that hit your nutritional numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The service offers a free tier with basic single-day planning, and a
          premium plan at <strong>$8.99 per month</strong> that unlocks weekly
          plans, grocery lists, and more food options. There&apos;s also a
          grocery delivery integration in some regions, though it&apos;s not
          widely available.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, Eat This Much treats meal planning as a math problem
          &mdash; plug in the numbers, get the output. That works for people who
          are strictly tracking macros. But for everyone else who just wants to
          eat well without feeling like they&apos;re being fed by an algorithm,
          it starts to feel mechanical pretty quickly.
        </p>

          Credit where it&apos;s due &mdash; Eat This Much does some things
          well, and it&apos;s earned a loyal user base for good reason:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Automatic planning</strong> &mdash; set your targets once

          <li>
            <strong>Calorie and macro control</strong> &mdash; fine-grained
            nutritional targeting for people who track closely
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dietary filters</strong> &mdash; support for common diets
            like keto, paleo, vegan, and vegetarian
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Grocery lists</strong> &mdash; premium users get a
            consolidated shopping list from their plan
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The concept itself</strong> &mdash; the idea of
            &ldquo;just tell me what to eat&rdquo; resonates with a lot of
            people, and Eat This Much was one of the first to do it

          The fundamental difference comes down to how the plans are made. Eat
          This Much pulls from a fixed recipe database and assembles meals that
          fit your macros. What&apos;s For Dinner uses{" "}
          <strong>Claude AI to generate completely original recipes</strong>{" "}
          every week &mdash; recipes that are designed around your taste, your
          dietary needs, and your budget, not just your calorie target.
        </p>
        <p>
          And at <strong>$4.99 per month</strong>, it&apos;s 44% cheaper than
          Eat This Much&apos;s premium plan.

        <p>
          Eat This Much treats meal planning like a calculator. We think it
          should feel more like a conversation with someone who actually knows
          how to cook. Here&apos;s where we diverge:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Original recipes, not database pulls
        </h3>
        <p>
          Eat This Much assembles plans from a fixed recipe database. After a
          few weeks, you start seeing the same meals on rotation &mdash; the
          same chicken stir-fry, the same overnight oats, the same protein
          smoothie. What&apos;s For Dinner uses Claude AI to{" "}
          <strong>generate completely original recipes from scratch</strong>{" "}
          every single week. Your preferences guide the output, and the AI is
          creative enough to keep things interesting without going off the
          rails. Week 12 feels as fresh as week 1.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Cuisine variety that actually works
        </h3>
        <p>
          Eat This Much lets you filter by broad categories, but the results
          often feel generic. Our AI understands cuisine at a deeper level
          &mdash; tell it you want Korean-inspired weeknight dinners and
          Mediterranean lunches, and it delivers exactly that. Not
          &ldquo;Asian-style chicken&rdquo; with soy sauce dumped on it, but
          actual dishes that respect the cuisine.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Budget-aware meal planning
        </h3>
        <p>
          Eat This Much doesn&apos;t factor in what things cost. It might
          suggest wagyu beef on a Tuesday and expect you not to blink. We let
          you choose between budget-friendly, moderate, and premium tiers, and
          the AI adjusts its ingredient choices accordingly. If you&apos;re
          feeding a family of four on a tight budget, every recipe reflects
          that.
        </p>

          Eat This Much&apos;s free tier gives you a single day of basic
          planning with limited food options. It&apos;s barely enough to
          evaluate whether the service is worth paying for. What&apos;s For
          Dinner gives you a full 3-day sample plan with no signup, no credit
          card, and no strings attached. You see exactly what the paid
          experience looks like before committing a single dollar.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Nearly half the price

        <p>
          At <strong>$4.99/month</strong>, What&apos;s For Dinner is
          significantly cheaper than Eat This Much&apos;s $8.99/month premium
