        Weekly Meal Plan: How to Plan Your Entire Week in 10 Minutes
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Every evening, the same question: &quot;What&apos;s for dinner?&quot;
          You open the fridge, stare at mismatched ingredients, scroll through
          recipes for 20 minutes, give up, and order delivery. Again. Studies
          suggest the average person spends over 40 minutes a day deciding what
          to eat, shopping for ingredients reactively, and cooking without a
          plan. That&apos;s nearly 5 hours a week lost to food indecision.
        </p>
        <p>
          A weekly meal plan fixes this in one sitting. You spend 10 minutes on
          Sunday picking meals for the entire week, build a single grocery list,
          shop once, and never wonder what&apos;s for dinner again. The rest of
          the week, you just execute. No browsing, no deciding, no last-minute
          grocery runs. Here&apos;s how to do it &mdash; and how to make it
          stick.

        <p>
          A weekly meal plan isn&apos;t a vague idea of &quot;eating healthier
          this week.&quot; It&apos;s a concrete schedule: every meal, every day,
          written down. Here&apos;s a realistic example for a household of two:

          Notice the pattern: breakfasts rotate between three simple options.
          Lunches are almost entirely leftovers from the previous dinner.
          Dinners use overlapping ingredients (chicken, eggs, and canned beans
          appear in multiple meals). Saturday has a built-in flex night. This
          isn&apos;t aspirational &mdash; it&apos;s a plan that actually
          survives a real week.

          The Manual Method (10-15 Minutes)
        </h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Pick 5 dinners.</strong> Not 7 &mdash; leave two nights for
            leftovers, takeout, or &quot;whatever&apos;s in the fridge.&quot;
            Choose recipes you know or simple ones with under 10 ingredients.
            Aim for variety: one chicken dish, one beef or pork, one
            vegetarian, one fish, one pasta or grain bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan breakfasts around 2-3 staples.</strong> You don&apos;t
            need seven unique breakfasts. Pick two or three &mdash; overnight
            oats, eggs and toast, yogurt and granola &mdash; and rotate them.
            Batch-prep overnight oats on Sunday for three days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lunches come from leftovers.</strong> Cook slightly more
            dinner than you need. Monday&apos;s chicken becomes Tuesday&apos;s
            lunch salad. Tuesday&apos;s tacos become Wednesday&apos;s taco bowl.
            This cuts your cooking in half.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Write one consolidated grocery list.</strong> Go through
            every recipe, list every ingredient, combine duplicates, and check
            what you already have at home. This is the step most people skip
            &mdash; and it&apos;s the one that saves the most money.

          The AI-Generated Method (Under 2 Minutes)

          does everything above automatically. You set your preferences once
          &mdash; dietary restrictions, household size, budget, cuisine
          preferences, foods you hate &mdash; and the AI generates a complete
          weekly meal plan with recipes and a grocery list. Every week, a fresh
          plan shows up. No browsing, no list-building, no recipe hunting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The manual method works well if you enjoy the process and have the
          time. But most people who meal plan manually do it consistently for
          about 4-6 weeks before it becomes another chore they quietly drop.
          The advantage of AI-generated plans is sustainability &mdash; it
          takes zero effort after setup, so the habit doesn&apos;t depend on
          your willpower or free time on Sunday afternoon.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The Grocery List Is the Whole Point
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          A meal plan without a grocery list is just a wish list. You know
          what you want to eat, but you don&apos;t know what to buy &mdash; so
          you still end up wandering the store, guessing quantities, and
          forgetting ingredients. The grocery list is where the actual time and
          money savings happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          A consolidated grocery list &mdash; one that combines ingredients
          across all your meals for the week &mdash; is dramatically more
          efficient than shopping recipe by recipe. You buy one container of
          Greek yogurt for breakfast and the marinade, not two. You buy one
          bunch of cilantro for tacos, pizza, and the soup, not three. Research
          suggests that planned grocery shopping reduces food spending by 20-25%
          compared to unplanned shopping.
        </p>

        How to Actually Stick to a Weekly Meal Plan
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Making a plan is easy. Following it on a Wednesday night when
          you&apos;re tired and the couch is calling is the hard part. These
          four habits separate people who meal plan for a month from people who
          meal plan for years:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Allow 1-2 flexible nights.</strong> Don&apos;t plan 7
            dinners. Plan 5 and leave Friday and Saturday open for leftovers,
            takeout, or &quot;I&apos;ll figure it out.&quot; Rigidity kills
            meal plans faster than anything. The nights you don&apos;t plan for
            are what keep you from abandoning the nights you do.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prep ingredients on Sunday, not full meals.</strong> You
            don&apos;t need to cook everything in advance. Just wash and chop
            vegetables, cook a batch of rice or quinoa, and marinate proteins.
            Twenty minutes of ingredient prep on Sunday cuts 10-15 minutes off
            every weeknight dinner. That&apos;s the difference between &quot;I
            can cook this&quot; and &quot;I don&apos;t have the energy.&quot;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep a rotation of 3 no-cook breakfasts.</strong> Overnight
            oats, yogurt parfaits, and smoothies. All can be prepped the night
            before or assembled in 3 minutes. If breakfast requires cooking on
            a weekday morning, it won&apos;t happen consistently. Save the
            pancakes and eggs for the weekend.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Let someone (or something) else do the planning.</strong>{" "}
            The biggest reason people quit meal planning is that the planning
            itself is tedious. If you find yourself dreading Sunday&apos;s
            planning session, that&apos;s a signal to automate it. An AI meal
            planner removes the weekly friction entirely &mdash; you still
            cook, but you never have to decide what to cook.

            <strong>Keto.</strong> Heavy on proteins and healthy fats, minimal
            carbs. Dinners revolve around meat, fish, eggs, and non-starchy
            vegetables. Breakfasts are eggs, avocado, or full-fat yogurt.
            Grocery lists skew toward the perimeter of the store &mdash; fresh
            produce, meat counter, dairy. See our{" "}

            <strong>Vegetarian.</strong> Beans, lentils, tofu, eggs, and dairy
            replace meat as protein sources. Weekly plans often include one big
            pot of beans or lentils that serves as the protein base for 3-4
            meals. Grocery lists tend to be cheaper. See our{" "}

            <strong>Mediterranean.</strong> Olive oil, fish, whole grains,
            vegetables, and legumes. One of the easiest diets to weekly-plan
            because the ingredients overlap so heavily &mdash; the same olive
            oil, feta, chickpeas, and lemon juice show up in almost every
            meal. See our{" "}

          <li>
            <strong>Gluten-free.</strong> Same planning method, but you swap
            pasta for rice or quinoa, use gluten-free bread, and check sauces
            for hidden wheat. The grocery list requires more label-reading, but
            the plan structure is identical. See our{" "}
