        Meal Planning for College Students: Dorm + Off-Campus Guide
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          College meal plans are one of the great scams of higher education.
          You pay $2,000 to $4,000 per semester for the privilege of eating
          the same five rotating entrees in a cafeteria that closes at 8 PM.
          That&apos;s $500 to $1,000 a month for food you&apos;d never
          voluntarily choose. And when the dining hall is closed &mdash;
          which is most of the time you&apos;re actually hungry &mdash;
          you&apos;re either ordering DoorDash or eating cereal straight out
          of the box at 11 PM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here&apos;s the good news: you can feed yourself better, for less
          money, with about 30 minutes of planning per week. Whether
          you&apos;re in a dorm with nothing but a microwave and a mini fridge,
          or off-campus with an actual kitchen, there&apos;s a system that works.
          And no, it doesn&apos;t involve learning to cook like a chef or
          spending your entire Sunday batch-cooking for the week.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Dorm room meals */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Dorm Room Meals (No Kitchen Needed)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          A microwave and a mini fridge. That&apos;s your entire kitchen. It
          sounds limiting, but you can make legitimately good meals with just
          these two appliances. Here are seven dorm-friendly meals that cost
          $2 to $4 per serving:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Overnight oats ($0.75/serving).</strong> Oats + milk + yogurt
            + honey in a jar. Prep the night before, grab it in the morning.
            Add banana or berries if you&apos;re feeling fancy. Takes literally
            2 minutes to prepare.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deli wraps ($2.50/serving).</strong> Tortilla + deli turkey
            or ham + cheese + lettuce + mustard. Keep ingredients in the mini
            fridge and assemble in 3 minutes. This is faster than walking to the
            dining hall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Microwave rice bowls ($3/serving).</strong> Instant rice
            (90-second microwave packs) + canned black beans + salsa + shredded
            cheese. Drain and rinse the beans, heat everything, layer it up.
            Filling, cheap, done in 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Upgraded instant ramen ($2/serving).</strong> Cook the ramen.
            Crack an egg into it while it&apos;s hot. Add frozen peas or spinach.
            Drizzle soy sauce and sriracha. This turns a $0.30 packet into an
            actual meal. Your dining hall wishes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PB&amp;J + banana ($1.50/serving).</strong> The classic. Whole
            wheat bread + peanut butter + jam + a banana on the side. This
            isn&apos;t glamorous but it&apos;s 400+ calories, 15g of protein,
            and zero cooking required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Canned soup upgrade ($2.50/serving).</strong> Progresso or
            Amy&apos;s soup + a handful of crackers + cheese on top. Microwave
            the soup, crumble crackers in, add shredded cheese while it&apos;s
            hot. Comfort food for the price of a vending machine snack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Microwave quesadilla ($2/serving).</strong> Tortilla + cheese
            + canned chicken or beans. Fold it, microwave for 90 seconds.
            It won&apos;t be crispy, but it&apos;ll be hot, cheesy, and
            satisfying.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Weekly grocery cost for all of this? About <strong>$25 to $35</strong>.
          Compare that to the dining hall&apos;s $125+ per week. You&apos;re
          eating better food, on your own schedule, for a fraction of the cost.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Off-campus with a kitchen */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Off-Campus with a Kitchen
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Once you have a stove and an oven, the game changes completely. You
          can make real meals for less than $4 per serving &mdash; meals that
          are genuinely good, not just &quot;good for a college student.&quot;
          Here are 10 staples that every student with a kitchen should know:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Pasta with jarred sauce ($1.50/serving).</strong> Boil pasta.
            Heat sauce. Done. Add ground beef or sausage if you want protein.
            This is the gateway drug to cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stir-fry ($3/serving).</strong> Any protein + frozen stir-fry
            vegetables + soy sauce + rice. Cooks in one pan in 15 minutes. Buy
            the big bag of frozen veggies &mdash; it lasts weeks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quesadillas ($2/serving).</strong> Now you can use a real pan.
            Tortilla + cheese + whatever&apos;s in the fridge. Crispy, golden,
            5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fried rice ($2.50/serving).</strong> Leftover rice + eggs +
            frozen peas and carrots + soy sauce. The best way to use yesterday&apos;s
            rice. Tastes better than takeout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sheet pan chicken and veggies ($3.50/serving).</strong> Chicken
            thighs + whatever vegetables you have + olive oil + seasoning. Put
            it all on a sheet pan, bake at 425&deg;F for 25 minutes. Zero effort,
            one pan to clean.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bean and cheese burritos ($1.50/serving).</strong> Canned
            beans + rice + cheese + salsa in a tortilla. Make 4 at once, wrap in
            foil, eat them all week. The ultimate batch meal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scrambled eggs and toast ($1.50/serving).</strong> Not just
            for breakfast. Eggs + toast + hot sauce is a complete meal any time
            of day. Add cheese and vegetables if you have them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>One-pot chili ($2.50/serving).</strong> Ground beef or turkey
            + canned beans + canned tomatoes + chili seasoning. Makes 6+ servings.
            Eat it with rice, over nachos, or straight out of the pot at midnight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chicken Caesar wraps ($3/serving).</strong> Rotisserie chicken
            (pre-cooked, $6 for 3+ meals) + romaine + Caesar dressing + tortilla.
            No cooking at all.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ramen upgrade &mdash; stove edition ($2.50/serving).</strong>{" "}
            Real ramen broth (miso paste + water) + soft-boiled egg + green
            onions + the noodles. Takes 10 minutes and tastes like a restaurant.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Weekly grocery cost? About <strong>$30 to $45</strong> for one person,
          covering all meals. That&apos;s $120 to $180 per month &mdash; less
          than half what most students spend on food. And you&apos;re eating
          better than 90% of your floor.

          It&apos;s Thursday. You have $15 in your account and payday
          isn&apos;t until Friday. This happens to every college student at
          least once a semester. Here&apos;s how to eat 5 meals for $15:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Buy these 5 items:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">

          <li>
            <strong>Rice and beans bowl</strong> &mdash; rice + black beans +
            hot sauce. Classic for a reason.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Egg fried rice</strong> &mdash; leftover rice + scrambled
            eggs + frozen veggies + soy sauce (borrow from a friend or grab a
            packet from the dining hall).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bean and egg scramble</strong> &mdash; eggs + beans +
            hot sauce. Surprisingly good.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Veggie rice bowl</strong> &mdash; rice + steamed frozen
            vegetables + eggs on top.

        Meal Prepping on Sunday for the Week
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Sunday meal prep gets a bad rep because people think it means spending
          6 hours cooking 21 meals in matching containers. It doesn&apos;t. For
          a college student, Sunday prep looks like this:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Cook a big pot of rice or pasta (10 min).</strong> This is
            your base for the week. Rice for stir-fries, fried rice, and bowls.
            Pasta for quick dinners.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook a batch of protein (20 min).</strong> Bake chicken
            thighs, brown ground beef, or hard-boil a dozen eggs. This goes
            into everything.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chop vegetables (10 min).</strong> If you bought fresh
            produce, chop it now. Bell peppers, onions, broccoli &mdash; into
            containers. You won&apos;t chop on a Tuesday night, but you will
            grab pre-chopped from the fridge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make overnight oats for the week (5 min).</strong> Five jars,
            all the same. Grab and go every morning.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Total time: <strong>45 minutes to an hour</strong>. That&apos;s one
          episode of a show. Put something on in the background and it flies by.
          The result: you have food ready to assemble into meals all week. No
          nightly cooking sessions. No deciding what to eat while hungry. Just
          open the fridge, grab components, assemble, eat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Storage tips:</strong> Use whatever containers you have &mdash;
          actual Tupperware, takeout containers you saved, mason jars. Label
          with masking tape if you&apos;re sharing a fridge with roommates (or
          if you&apos;ll forget what&apos;s in there by Wednesday). Most prepped
          food lasts 4 to 5 days in the fridge. If you make more than that,
          freeze the extras.

          Here&apos;s the irony: you&apos;re paying thousands for a
          &quot;meal plan&quot; that gives you cafeteria food on someone else&apos;s
          schedule. Meanwhile, an actual personalized meal plan that tells you
          exactly what to cook, gives you recipes, and generates a grocery list
          costs $7.99 a month.

          That&apos;s one DoorDash order. One and a half Starbucks drinks. For

          one person on $40 a week. The recipes are simple, the grocery list is
          organized, and a new plan shows up in your inbox every week without
