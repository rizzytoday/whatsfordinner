      </p>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          eMeals has been around for years, and for a long time it was the go-to
          for families who wanted simple weekly meal plans without the fuss.
          Pick a plan, get your recipes, send your grocery list to Walmart or
          Kroger, done. It worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          But meal planning has changed. AI can now generate recipes tailored to
          your exact preferences, dietary needs, and budget &mdash; not just
          shuffle through a fixed database of the same 200 meals. If you&apos;ve
          been using eMeals and feel like the plans have gotten stale, or if the
          app feels like it hasn&apos;t evolved in years, you&apos;re not alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What&apos;s For Dinner</strong> is a modern alternative that
          uses AI to create genuinely personalized meal plans every week &mdash;
          plans that learn from your feedback, adapt to any dietary restriction,
          and cost less than eMeals.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* --- What is eMeals? --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        What is eMeals?
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          eMeals is a meal planning subscription service that sends you weekly
          meal plans with recipes and a corresponding grocery list. Its biggest
          selling point has always been grocery store integration &mdash; you can
          send your shopping list directly to Walmart, Kroger, Instacart, or
          other supported stores for pickup or delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plans are organized by dietary style (Clean Eating, Low Carb, Kid
          Friendly, Quick &amp; Healthy, etc.) and you pick the one that fits
          your household. Pricing sits at{" "}
          <strong>$5.99/month or $59.99/year</strong>, which is reasonable for
          what you get.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem isn&apos;t that eMeals is bad. It&apos;s that it
          hasn&apos;t meaningfully evolved. The recipes feel generic after a few
          months, the dietary &ldquo;plans&rdquo; are rigid categories rather
          than true personalization, and the app itself feels like it was
          designed in 2018 and left on autopilot. There&apos;s no AI, no
          learning from your preferences, and no way to tell the system
          &ldquo;I loved that Thai curry but hated the meatloaf&rdquo; and have
          it actually adjust.
        </p>
      </div>

      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          eMeals built a loyal user base for good reasons. Here&apos;s what
          keeps people subscribed:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Grocery store integration</strong> &mdash; sending your
            shopping list straight to Walmart, Kroger, or Instacart is genuinely
            convenient and saves real time
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Family-friendly recipes</strong> &mdash; the plans are
            designed for households with kids, with recipes that don&apos;t
            require adventurous palates
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simple weekly structure</strong> &mdash; no decision fatigue,
            just open the app and cook what&apos;s on the list
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Store-specific pricing</strong> &mdash; seeing estimated
            costs based on your preferred grocery store helps with budgeting
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Low commitment</strong> &mdash; at $5.99/month, it&apos;s
            cheap enough that most people don&apos;t think twice about the
            subscription
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are solid foundations. But there&apos;s a gap between
          &ldquo;simple weekly plans from a recipe database&rdquo; and
          &ldquo;plans that are actually built for{" "}
          <em>you</em>.&rdquo; That&apos;s where a modern{" "}

          The trade-off is honest: eMeals has grocery store integration that we
          don&apos;t. If one-tap Walmart ordering is the single most important
          feature to you, eMeals still has that edge. But if you care about the
          quality and variety of the actual recipes &mdash; the food you&apos;re
          putting on the table &mdash; What&apos;s For Dinner is a significant
          upgrade.

        What&apos;s different (and better)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          eMeals was built in an era when meal planning meant curating a recipe
          database and matching it to broad dietary categories. That model
          worked, but it has a ceiling. Here&apos;s where AI changes things:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Every plan is unique &mdash; no recipe rotation
        </h3>
        <p>
          The most common complaint about eMeals is that the recipes start
          repeating after a few months. That&apos;s inevitable when you&apos;re
          pulling from a fixed library. What&apos;s For Dinner uses Claude AI to{" "}
          <strong>generate original meal plans from scratch</strong> every week.
          Your plan from week 12 won&apos;t look anything like week 1. The AI
          draws from the entire world of cooking, not a predetermined recipe
          database.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Real personalization, not preset categories
        </h3>
        <p>
          eMeals asks you to pick from categories like &ldquo;Clean
          Eating&rdquo; or &ldquo;Kid Friendly.&rdquo; But what if you&apos;re
          doing clean eating <em>and</em> your kid is allergic to tree nuts{" "}
          <em>and</em> you hate eggplant <em>and</em> you want mostly
          Mediterranean food on a budget? eMeals can&apos;t handle that.
          Our AI can &mdash; because it reads your preferences in plain English
          and generates plans that respect all of them simultaneously.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Plans that learn from your feedback
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is the feature eMeals simply doesn&apos;t have. With What&apos;s
          For Dinner, you can thumbs-up meals you loved and thumbs-down ones
          that didn&apos;t work. The AI uses that feedback to refine future
          plans. Over time, your meal plans get better because the system
          actually understands what you enjoy cooking and eating &mdash; not just
          what dietary label you picked.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Email delivery &mdash; no app needed
        </h3>
        <p>
          eMeals relies on its app, which many users find dated and clunky. We
          send your{" "}
          <Link
            href="/blog/ai-meal-planner"

          straight to your inbox every week. Open it on your phone at the
          grocery store, forward it to your partner, or print it out for the
          fridge. No app updates, no login screens, no friction.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          A dollar cheaper &mdash; and a free trial with no signup
        </h3>
        <p>
          At <strong>$4.99/month</strong> versus eMeals&apos; $5.99, you save a
          bit on the subscription. But the bigger difference is that we let you
          try before you buy. Enter your preferences, get a full sample plan
          immediately &mdash; no credit card, no account creation. If you
          don&apos;t like what you see, you haven&apos;t spent a cent. eMeals
