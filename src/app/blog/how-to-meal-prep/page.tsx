        How to Meal Prep for the Week in Under 2 Hours
      </h1>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Most people know that meal prep saves time and money. Fewer people
          actually do it &mdash; because the &quot;how&quot; is where things fall
          apart. You find a dozen recipes on Pinterest, buy $90 worth of
          groceries, spend four hours in the kitchen on Sunday, and burn out by
          week two.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesn&apos;t have to be that complicated. This guide breaks meal
          prep into a repeatable 2-hour Sunday routine that anyone can stick
          with &mdash; whether you&apos;re cooking for one or feeding a family.
        </p>

        Why Most Meal Prep Fails
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Before getting into what works, it helps to understand what doesn&apos;t.
          Most meal prep attempts fail for three predictable reasons:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Too many recipes.</strong> Trying to cook five completely
            different dinners from scratch on a Sunday afternoon is a recipe for
            exhaustion, not efficiency. The goal is to prep <em>components</em>,
            not complete dishes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overcomplicating it.</strong> Meal prep doesn&apos;t require
            color-coded containers, a $200 gadget collection, or Instagram-worthy
            bento boxes. It requires a plan and two free hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No system.</strong> Winging it each week means you&apos;re
            making dozens of micro-decisions &mdash; what to cook, what to buy,
            how much to make, what goes in the fridge vs. freezer. Without a
            system, decision fatigue kills the habit before it sticks.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The fix is simple: fewer recipes, more structure, and a plan that&apos;s
          ready <em>before</em> you walk into the kitchen.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* The 2-hour Sunday method */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The 2-Hour Sunday Method
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          This method splits meal prep into three phases across two days. The
          actual cooking and prepping happens in a single 2-hour block on Sunday
          afternoon.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          Phase 1: Plan on Saturday (15 minutes)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Decide what you&apos;re eating for the week. You don&apos;t need seven
          unique dinners &mdash; three to four recipes with leftovers will cover
          most weeknights. Pick two proteins, two grain or starch bases, and a
          few vegetables you can roast or chop in bulk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Write your{" "}
          <Link
            href="/blog/meal-plan-with-grocery-list"
            className="text-orange-500 hover:text-orange-600 underline"
          >
            grocery list
          </Link>{" "}
          based on the plan. Group items by store section (produce, meat, dairy,
          pantry) so you&apos;re not zigzagging through aisles.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          Phase 2: Shop on Sunday Morning (30&ndash;45 minutes)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Shop with your list and nothing else. No browsing, no impulse buys.
          If your list is organized by section, a full grocery run takes 30 to
          45 minutes. Go early &mdash; stores are less crowded before 10 AM,
          and you&apos;ll be home with time to spare.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6 mb-2">
          Phase 3: Prep on Sunday Afternoon (2 hours)
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is the main event. The key is running tasks in parallel &mdash;
          while rice cooks on the stove, you&apos;re roasting vegetables in the
          oven and slicing proteins on the cutting board. Here&apos;s the order:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Start the oven and stovetop first.</strong> Get grains
            cooking and vegetables roasting before you do anything else. These
            are hands-off tasks that run in the background.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook proteins.</strong> Season and cook your proteins (chicken
            thighs, ground turkey, tofu, beans) while grains and veggies are
            going. Baking sheet proteins are ideal &mdash; minimal supervision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wash and chop produce.</strong> While things cook, wash
            lettuce, chop onions, mince garlic, slice bell peppers. Store in
            containers so they&apos;re grab-ready during the week.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Portion and store.</strong> Once everything is cooked and
            cooled, divide into containers. Label anything going in the freezer
            with the date.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make one sauce or dressing.</strong> A single versatile
            sauce (chimichurri, tahini dressing, teriyaki) transforms plain
            prepped components into meals that don&apos;t taste like leftovers.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      {/* What to prep vs. cook fresh */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        What to Prep vs. What to Cook Fresh
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Not everything benefits from being prepped in advance. Here&apos;s a
          practical breakdown:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Prep ahead (stores well for 4&ndash;5 days):</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>Grains &mdash; rice, quinoa, farro, pasta</li>
          <li>Proteins &mdash; grilled chicken, baked tofu, hard-boiled eggs, cooked ground meat</li>
          <li>Roasted vegetables &mdash; sweet potatoes, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower</li>
          <li>Beans and legumes &mdash; cook a big batch or drain canned</li>
          <li>Sauces and dressings &mdash; most keep for a full week</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Cook or assemble fresh:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>Salads &mdash; dress right before eating, never ahead</li>
          <li>Fried eggs or omelets &mdash; take 5 minutes, taste terrible reheated</li>
          <li>Avocado &mdash; slice day-of to avoid browning</li>
          <li>Crispy items &mdash; anything breaded or fried loses its texture overnight</li>
          <li>Fish &mdash; most fish reheats poorly; cook it the night you eat it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The trick is prepping <em>components</em> that mix and match. Sunday&apos;s
          grilled chicken becomes Monday&apos;s grain bowl, Tuesday&apos;s wrap, and
          Wednesday&apos;s salad topping &mdash; without eating the same meal three
          times.
        </p>
      </div>

        Storage and Reheating Tips
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Good storage is what separates meal prep that lasts through Friday from
          food that goes bad by Wednesday.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Use airtight glass containers.</strong> They don&apos;t
            stain, don&apos;t leach chemicals, and reheat evenly in the
            microwave. A set of 10 rectangular containers covers most needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cool food before storing.</strong> Putting hot food in the
            fridge raises the internal temperature and can spoil other items.
            Let everything cool to room temperature first (but don&apos;t leave
            it out longer than two hours).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fridge life: 4&ndash;5 days max.</strong> Cooked proteins
            and grains stay safe for about four days in the fridge. If your prep
            needs to last beyond Wednesday, freeze half on Sunday and thaw
            Thursday morning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Freezer-friendly meals.</strong> Soups, stews, chili,
            curries, and cooked grains all freeze beautifully. Portion into
            single-serve containers for quick weeknight defrosting. These keep
            for 2&ndash;3 months.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reheat with a splash of water.</strong> Add a tablespoon of
            water to grains and proteins before microwaving. It prevents drying
            out and keeps the texture close to fresh.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Store wet and dry separately.</strong> Keep sauces in small
            jars or containers apart from grains and proteins. Combine when
            you&apos;re ready to eat &mdash; this prevents soggy meals.
          </li>

          The 2-hour method works &mdash; but it still assumes you&apos;re
          spending 15 to 20 minutes on Saturday choosing recipes and building a
          grocery list. Over a year, that&apos;s 13+ hours of planning alone.

          That means your Sunday routine shrinks from &quot;plan + shop +
          prep&quot; to just &quot;shop + prep.&quot; The AI handles the
          cognitive load &mdash; deciding what to cook, balancing nutrition
          across the week, making sure ingredients overlap so nothing goes to
          waste &mdash; and you handle the knives and cutting boards.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s the difference between meal prep as a <em>project</em> and
          meal prep as a <em>habit</em>. Projects require motivation. Habits
          just need a trigger and a system.
