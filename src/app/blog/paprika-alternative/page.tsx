          Paprika is a solid recipe manager. It clips recipes from the web,
          organizes them into categories, builds grocery lists, and syncs
          across your devices. If you want a digital recipe binder, it does
          the job well.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here&apos;s the thing &mdash; Paprika doesn&apos;t actually
          plan your meals. It organizes the recipes <em>you</em> find. You
          still have to browse food blogs, clip recipes one by one, drag them
          onto a calendar, and figure out what to cook each week. The mental
          load of &ldquo;what&apos;s for dinner?&rdquo; never really goes
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;re tired of doing all the work yourself,{" "}
          <strong>What&apos;s For Dinner</strong> takes a completely different
          approach. Instead of organizing recipes you&apos;ve already found,
          it uses AI to generate a complete, personalized meal plan for you
          every week &mdash; with a grocery list included. You open your
          email and start cooking.
        </p>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Paprika Recipe Manager is a cross-platform app available on iOS,
          Android, Mac, and Windows. It&apos;s been around for years and has
          earned a loyal following among home cooks who want a clean, reliable
          place to store their recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its standout feature is the <strong>recipe clipper</strong> &mdash;
          point it at any recipe URL and it pulls in the ingredients, steps,
          and photos automatically. From there you can organize recipes into
          categories, scale servings, create grocery lists, set cooking
          timers, and plan meals on a drag-and-drop calendar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paprika uses a one-time purchase model:{" "}
          <strong>$4.99 per platform</strong>. That means if you want it on
          your iPhone and your Mac, you&apos;re paying $9.98. Add a Windows
          machine and an Android tablet, and you&apos;re at $19.96. Cloud
          sync keeps everything in step across devices, and offline access
          means your recipes are always available.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s a well-built tool for what it does. But what it does is
          <em> organize</em> &mdash; it doesn&apos;t <em>think</em> for you.

          The core difference is simple: Paprika is a tool you fill with your
          own effort. What&apos;s For Dinner is a service that does the work
          for you. One requires hours of recipe hunting and manual planning.
          The other requires two minutes of setup and then shows up in your
          inbox every week, ready to go.

          To be clear &mdash; you don&apos;t have to ditch Paprika entirely.
          It&apos;s a fine recipe manager, and if you enjoy collecting recipes,
          keep using it. But if your real goal is to stop spending time
          <em> deciding</em> what to cook, that&apos;s where What&apos;s For
          Dinner comes in.
        </p>

          Paprika and What&apos;s For Dinner aren&apos;t really competitors
          &mdash; they&apos;re different categories of tool. But if you&apos;re
          choosing where to put your time and money, here&apos;s why the AI
          approach wins for most people:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Zero recipe hunting
        </h3>
        <p>
          With Paprika, you&apos;re the one scouring food blogs, scrolling
          through Pinterest, and clipping recipes one by one. That&apos;s fun
          if cooking is your hobby. But if you just want to eat well without
          spending hours planning, it&apos;s a chore. What&apos;s For Dinner
          generates complete meal plans &mdash; breakfast, lunch, dinner, and
          optional snacks &mdash; with zero effort on your part. The AI handles
          the recipe discovery, variety, and nutritional balance.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          True dietary intelligence
        </h3>
        <p>
          Paprika lets you tag and filter recipes, but it doesn&apos;t
          understand your diet. If you&apos;re pescatarian with a tree nut
          allergy who prefers Mediterranean food, you have to manually ensure
          every recipe you clip fits those constraints. Our AI takes all of
          that into account automatically &mdash; every meal in every plan
          respects your restrictions without you having to check.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Weekly automation

          start cooking.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          No app to download or update
        </h3>
        <p>
          Paprika requires a separate purchase on every platform &mdash; $4.99
          for iOS, another $4.99 for Mac, another for Android. What&apos;s For
          Dinner is email-based. It works on every device you already own,
          requires no downloads, and never needs updating. Forward it to your
          partner, pull it up on your phone at the store, or print it for the
          fridge.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Budget-aware planning
        </h3>
        <p>
          Paprika has no concept of cost. It stores whatever recipes you clip,
          regardless of whether the ingredients fit your budget. What&apos;s
          For Dinner lets you choose between budget-friendly, moderate, and
          premium tiers &mdash; the AI adjusts ingredient choices so your
          weekly plan actually matches what you can spend.
