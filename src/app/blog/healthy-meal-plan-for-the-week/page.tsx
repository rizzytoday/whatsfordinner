          <Link href="/blog/weekly-meal-plan" className="text-orange-500 underline">healthy meal plan</Link> is

          minutes, nothing weird or expensive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trick isn&apos;t willpower. It&apos;s removing the daily decision of
          &ldquo;what should I eat?&rdquo; When the answer is already written down
          and the groceries are already in your fridge, eating well becomes the path
          of least resistance.

        What Makes a Meal Plan &ldquo;Healthy&rdquo;?
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          A healthy meal plan isn&apos;t about restriction. It&apos;s about
          consistency and balance. Here&apos;s what actually matters:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Balanced macros.</strong> Every meal has protein, complex carbs,
            and healthy fats. This keeps you full, energized, and not craving sugar
            at 3pm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Variety across the week.</strong> Chicken on Monday, salmon on
            Wednesday, beans on Friday. Different proteins, different vegetables,
            different colors on your plate. That&apos;s how you get a range of
            nutrients without thinking about it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Realistic portions.</strong> Not 200-calorie meals that leave
            you raiding the pantry an hour later. Real portions &mdash; 400&ndash;600
            calories per meal &mdash; that keep you satisfied until the next one.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Meals you&apos;ll actually eat.</strong> The healthiest meal
            plan in the world is worthless if you hate every recipe and order pizza
            by Thursday. Good nutrition has to taste good, or it doesn&apos;t stick.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is not a crash diet. There&apos;s no calorie floor, no food groups
          to eliminate, no supplements to buy. Just real food, cooked simply,
          portioned sensibly.
        </p>
