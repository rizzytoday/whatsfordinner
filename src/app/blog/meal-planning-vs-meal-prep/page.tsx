        Meal Planning vs. Meal Prep: You Need Both (But Start Here)
      </h1>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          These two terms get used interchangeably, and it causes real confusion.
          Someone says &quot;I should start meal planning&quot; and pictures
          themselves spending 4 hours on Sunday filling Tupperware containers. Or
          they say &quot;I want to meal prep&quot; and jump straight to batch
          cooking without any idea what they&apos;re actually making. Both
          approaches fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meal planning and meal prep are two different things. They work together
          beautifully — but you only <em>need</em> one of them to transform how
          you eat. Here&apos;s the difference, why it matters, and which one to
          start with.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        What is meal planning?
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Meal planning is <strong>deciding what you&apos;ll eat</strong> for the
          week and <strong>making a grocery list</strong> from those decisions. That&apos;s
          it. No cooking involved. No containers. No Sunday afternoon in the kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
          A meal plan answers three questions:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>What am I eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day?</li>
          <li>What ingredients do I need to buy?</li>
          <li>What do I already have at home?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can meal plan with a notebook, a spreadsheet, or an app. The output
          is always the same: a list of meals for the week and a shopping list. You
          do one grocery run, and for the rest of the week, you know exactly
          what&apos;s for dinner before 5pm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The magic of meal planning isn&apos;t efficiency — it&apos;s{" "}
          <strong>eliminating decision fatigue</strong>. The question &quot;what
          should I eat?&quot; is answered before it comes up. That single change
          reduces takeout orders, food waste, and the low-grade stress of staring
          into the fridge every evening.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* --- What is meal prep --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        What is meal prep?
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Meal prep is <strong>cooking some or all of your meals in advance</strong>,
          typically in a batch session on the weekend. You cook multiple portions
          of several dishes, portion them into containers, and store them in the
          fridge or freezer. During the week, you reheat and eat.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few common approaches to meal prep:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Full meal prep:</strong> Cook all lunches and dinners for the
            week. Sunday is a 3&ndash;4 hour cooking session. Weeknight cooking
            time: 5 minutes (reheat).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ingredient prep:</strong> Wash and chop vegetables, cook
            grains, marinate proteins. You still cook each meal, but the prep work
            is done. Weeknight cooking time: 15&ndash;20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Batch cooking:</strong> Make large batches of 2&ndash;3 dishes
            that reheat well (soups, stews, casseroles, grain bowls). Eat them
            across multiple days. Weeknight cooking time: 5&ndash;10 minutes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Meal prep is a <em>time-shifting</em> strategy. You&apos;re not spending
          less total time cooking — you&apos;re moving it all to one block so your
          weeknights are free. For some people, this trade is perfect. For others,
          spending 3 hours cooking on Sunday sounds miserable.
        </p>
      </div>

        The key insight most people miss
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          <strong>You can meal plan without meal prepping.</strong> But you
          can&apos;t meal prep without a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think about it: if you decide to &quot;meal prep&quot; on Sunday but
          haven&apos;t planned what you&apos;re making, you&apos;ll stand in the
          kitchen with no idea what to cook, Google &quot;easy meal prep recipes,&quot;
          get overwhelmed by 47 options, and end up ordering pizza. The prep failed
          because there was no plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you have a{" "}

            weekly meal plan
          </Link>{" "}
          and a grocery list, you can skip the prep entirely. Just cook each meal
          fresh when it&apos;s time. Monday&apos;s dinner? Pull up the recipe at
          6pm, cook for 25 minutes, eat. No containers. No Sunday session. No
          reheated chicken for the fourth day in a row.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Meal planning is the foundation. Meal prep is an optional
          upgrade.</strong> Most people who &quot;fail at meal prep&quot; actually
          failed at meal planning. Fix the plan, and prep becomes easy — or
          unnecessary.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>

          <li>
            You need packed lunches for work and won&apos;t cook in the morning
          </li>
          <li>
            You&apos;re training or on a strict diet where portioned meals help
            with adherence
          </li>
          <li>
            You actually enjoy the Sunday cooking ritual (some people do!)
          </li>
          <li>
            You&apos;re comfortable eating similar meals 2&ndash;3 days in a row

          The ideal workflow looks like this:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Saturday/Sunday morning:</strong> Your meal plan arrives (via
            email or app). Review the week&apos;s meals and grocery list.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sunday afternoon:</strong> One grocery run using the
            consolidated list. Takes 30&ndash;45 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sunday evening (optional):</strong> Prep ingredients for the
            week — wash greens, chop vegetables, cook a batch of grains, marinate
            proteins. Takes 45&ndash;90 minutes if you choose to do it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Weeknights:</strong> Pull up tonight&apos;s recipe. Ingredients
            are prepped (or not — still works either way). Cook and eat in 20&ndash;40
            minutes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The plan is the non-negotiable. The prep is the accelerator. Together,
          they make weeknight cooking feel effortless. But if you only do one,
          do the plan. Every time.

          and cook from it for one week. Don&apos;t prep anything in advance. Just
          follow the plan each evening. If it works — if dinner is less stressful,

          the real problem.
