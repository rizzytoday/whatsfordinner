        AI Meal Planner: How It Works and Why It&apos;s Better
      </h1>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          You open the fridge at 6 PM, stare at a random assortment of
          ingredients, and wonder — for the hundredth time — what to cook. It
          doesn&apos;t have to be this way. An AI meal planner takes everything
          you care about — dietary restrictions, household size, budget, cooking
          skill, and cuisine preferences — and turns it into a complete weekly
          plan, delivered to your inbox before you ever have to think about it.

        What Is an AI Meal Planner?
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          An AI meal planner uses artificial intelligence to generate
          personalized meal plans tailored to your life. Unlike traditional
          recipe apps that pull from a static database and hope something fits,
          an AI meal planner considers the full picture: your dietary
          restrictions (keto, vegetarian, gluten-free, halal — whatever you
          need), how many people you&apos;re feeding, how much you want to spend
          on groceries, your comfort level in the kitchen, and the cuisines you
          actually enjoy eating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result isn&apos;t a random collection of recipes. It&apos;s a
          coherent seven-day plan where ingredients overlap intelligently, meals
          build on each other, and nothing goes to waste. The AI creates plans{" "}
          <em>specifically for you</em> — not a one-size-fits-all template with
          your name slapped on it.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* How traditional meal planning fails */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        How Traditional Meal Planning Fails
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          If you&apos;ve tried meal planning manually, you already know the
          pain. Research suggests home cooks spend upwards of three hours per
          week browsing recipes, cross-referencing ingredients, and building
          shopping lists. That&apos;s three hours of decision-making before you
          even turn on the stove.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipe apps help with discovery but not planning. They&apos;ll give
          you a great chicken tikka masala recipe, but they won&apos;t tell you
          what to do with the leftover yogurt and cilantro on Wednesday. There&apos;s
          no logic connecting Monday&apos;s dinner to Tuesday&apos;s lunch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meal kit services like HelloFresh solve the planning problem but
          create a cost problem. At $60 to $120+ per month for just dinners,
          you&apos;re paying a steep premium for the convenience of not having to
          think. And you still need to figure out breakfast and lunch on your
          own. For a deeper look at cost,{" "}

        <p>
          What&apos;s For Dinner uses Claude, Anthropic&apos;s AI, to generate a
          unique meal plan for every subscriber every week. Here&apos;s the
          process:

        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Set your preferences once.</strong> A quick 5-step
            onboarding captures your dietary restrictions, household size,
            budget range, cooking skill level, and favorite cuisines. Takes about
            two minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Receive a tailored 7-day plan.</strong> Every Sunday, a
            complete meal plan lands in your inbox — breakfast, lunch, and dinner
            for seven days. Each plan is generated fresh by AI, not recycled from
            a template library.

            <strong>Get a consolidated grocery list.</strong> No more

            <strong>Regenerate if you don&apos;t love it.</strong> Not feeling

            regenerate up to two times per week at no extra cost.

            <strong>Delivered by email.</strong> No app to download, no login to

        </ol>
        <p>
          The whole system is designed so you spend about two minutes setting up

        AI Meal Planner vs. ChatGPT for Meal Planning
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Yes, you can ask ChatGPT to generate a meal plan. Plenty of people do.
          But there&apos;s a meaningful gap between &quot;AI that can make a meal
          plan if you prompt it correctly&quot; and &quot;an AI meal planner
          built for the job.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          With ChatGPT, you have to re-explain your preferences every single
          time. Gluten-free, family of four, $100/week budget, mostly
          Mediterranean — you&apos;re writing that prompt from scratch each
          Sunday. There&apos;s no memory between sessions (unless you manually
          configure it), no formatted grocery list, and definitely no email
          delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          What&apos;s For Dinner stores your preferences permanently, generates
          plans on a schedule, formats everything cleanly, and delivers it
          without you lifting a finger. It&apos;s the difference between having
          access to a tool and having a system that runs itself.

          <li>
            <strong>Families with dietary restrictions</strong> — juggling
            allergies, preferences, and kid-friendly meals is exponentially
