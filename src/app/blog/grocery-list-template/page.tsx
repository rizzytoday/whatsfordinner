        <p>
          Most grocery lists are random. You walk through the store adding
          whatever looks good, forget half the things you actually need, and
          come home with ingredients that don&apos;t make a single complete
          meal. A bag of spinach that wilts in three days. A block of cheese
          with no plan for it. Chicken thighs that sit in the fridge until
          you throw them out.

        Why Most Grocery Lists Don&apos;t Work
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The typical grocery list is a brain dump. You write down whatever
          you remember needing, in no particular order, with no connection
          to actual meals. Then you get to the store and three things happen:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Organized by impulse, not by store section.</strong> You
            zigzag from produce to dairy to produce again because your list
            has &quot;bananas&quot; on line 1 and &quot;avocados&quot; on line 15.
            Every backtrack costs you time and willpower.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No connection to actual meals.</strong> You buy
            ingredients that sound good in isolation but don&apos;t combine
            into anything. Tuesday night you stare at a fridge full of food
            and still order takeout because nothing goes together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Missing quantities.</strong> &quot;Chicken&quot; on your
            list could mean one breast or five pounds. Without knowing
            how many meals you&apos;re making and how many servings each needs,
            you either overbuy and waste food or underbuy and run out
            mid-week.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The fix isn&apos;t a prettier list. It&apos;s a list that&apos;s
          built backward from a plan &mdash; starting with the meals, then
          extracting exactly the ingredients you need, organized so you can
          walk the store in one pass.
        </p>

          &quot;chicken thighs (2 lbs)&quot; because the plan calls for
          two recipes that each need a pound. Every item is there for a

          with recipes and a matching grocery list every week. It knows your
          diet, your budget, your household size, and what you actually like
          to eat. The grocery list is built from the recipes automatically
          &mdash; quantities combined, organized by store section, nothing
          extra.
