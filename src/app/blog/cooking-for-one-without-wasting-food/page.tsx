        Cooking for One Without Wasting Food (It&apos;s Not Just You)

        <p>
          You buy a head of broccoli with the best intentions. You use half of it on
          Monday. By Thursday, the other half is yellow and sad. Into the trash it goes,
          along with $2 and whatever was left of your motivation to cook this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cooking for one isn&apos;t hard because you lack skill. It&apos;s hard because
          the entire grocery system is built for families. Chicken comes in family packs.
          Recipes serve 4-6. A bag of spinach is enough for three salads but turns to
          slime in four days. You&apos;re not bad at cooking &mdash; you&apos;re fighting
          a system that wasn&apos;t designed for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The average American household wastes about 30% of the food they buy. For single
          people, that number is even higher because portions don&apos;t scale down
          easily. But it doesn&apos;t have to be this way. With a few simple strategies,
          you can cook for one without throwing half your groceries in the trash.

        Why Cooking for One Wastes So Much Food
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          It&apos;s not a willpower problem. It&apos;s a structural problem:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Bulk packaging.</strong> Chicken breasts come in packs of 4-6.
            Ground beef starts at a pound. A bunch of cilantro is enough for five meals
            but you need it for one. The grocery store is optimized for families buying
            in bulk, not individuals buying portions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recipes scaled for 4.</strong> Almost every recipe online serves
            &quot;4-6.&quot; You can halve it, but then you need half an onion, 1.5
            tablespoons of something, and 6 ounces of chicken. The math gets annoying
            fast, so you make the full recipe, eat one portion, put the rest in the
            fridge, and &quot;forget&quot; about it until it grows a personality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Produce spoilage timelines.</strong> Fresh berries: 3-5 days. Salad
            greens: 3-4 days. Avocados: ripe for about 12 minutes. Fresh herbs: 4-5
            days. If you don&apos;t have a plan for these ingredients within a few days
            of buying them, they&apos;re going in the trash.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The &quot;I&apos;ll use it later&quot; lie.</strong> We&apos;ve all
            told ourselves we&apos;d use that second bell pepper, that remaining half
            onion, that open can of coconut milk. We won&apos;t. We both know it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      {/* The freezer is your best friend */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The Freezer Is Your Best Friend
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          If you&apos;re cooking for one, the freezer isn&apos;t optional &mdash;
          it&apos;s your entire strategy. Everything that won&apos;t get used within a
          few days goes in the freezer immediately. Not &quot;later.&quot; Now.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Chicken thighs/breasts:</strong> When you get home, separate them
            individually into freezer bags or wrap. Pull out one at a time as needed.
            Defrost in the fridge overnight or in cold water for 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cooked rice:</strong> Make a big batch, portion into single-serving
            containers, freeze. Microwave from frozen in 2 minutes. This is how meal
            prep works when you&apos;re one person.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bread:</strong> Freeze the whole loaf. Pull out individual slices
            and toast them directly from frozen. They taste the same. This is the
            single biggest food waste reducer for solo cooks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sauces and broths:</strong> Pour into ice cube trays, freeze, pop
            out and store in a bag. Each cube is about 2 tablespoons. Need a splash of
            broth? Grab two cubes. Leftover pasta sauce? Freeze it in portions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bananas going brown:</strong> Peel, break in half, freeze. Use for
            smoothies or banana bread later. Stop throwing away bananas.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The freezer turns a 3-day shelf life into a 3-month shelf life. Once you get
          into the habit of freezing things the day you buy them, food waste drops
          dramatically.
        </p>

        Buy These, Skip Those
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Not all groceries are created equal when you&apos;re shopping for one. Some
          ingredients are designed to last. Others are a race against the clock.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Buy these (they last):</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li><strong>Frozen vegetables.</strong> Same nutrition as fresh, last 3+ months, already chopped. Frozen broccoli, peas, stir-fry mixes, and spinach are game changers for solo cooks.</li>
          <li><strong>Eggs.</strong> Last 4-5 weeks in the fridge. Cheap, versatile, high protein. The perfect single-person ingredient.</li>
          <li><strong>Canned goods.</strong> Beans, tomatoes, tuna, coconut milk. Years of shelf life. Open when you need them.</li>
          <li><strong>Hardy produce.</strong> Carrots (3-4 weeks), cabbage (2 months!), onions (2-4 weeks), potatoes (2-4 weeks), apples (4-6 weeks). These are the produce that actually survives solo cooking timelines.</li>
          <li><strong>Hard cheeses.</strong> Parmesan and cheddar last 3-4 weeks, sometimes longer. Way better than soft cheeses that go bad in a week.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4"><strong>Skip these (waste traps):</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li><strong>Fresh herbs.</strong> Buy paste or dried instead. A bunch of cilantro costs $1 and you&apos;ll use 10% of it. A tube of cilantro paste costs $3 and lasts months in the fridge.</li>
          <li><strong>Bagged salad mix.</strong> Goes slimy in 2-3 days. Buy a whole head of romaine (lasts 1-2 weeks) or skip salad and eat your veggies cooked.</li>
          <li><strong>Bulk meat without a freeze plan.</strong> If you buy a 3-pound pack of ground beef and don&apos;t portion and freeze it immediately, you&apos;ll use a third and waste the rest.</li>
          <li><strong>Specialty ingredients.</strong> That bottle of fish sauce for the one Thai recipe? You&apos;ll use it once and it&apos;ll sit in your fridge for two years. Only buy specialty items if they work across multiple meals.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      {/* The overlapping ingredient strategy */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The Overlapping Ingredient Strategy
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          This is the single most important concept for cooking solo without waste:
          plan meals that share ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of making three completely different meals with three different protein
          sources, three different vegetables, and three different sauces &mdash; pick
          one protein and use it three ways:
        </p>
        <div className="bg-stone-50 rounded-xl p-6 my-4">
          <p className="font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-3">Example: One pack of chicken thighs, three meals</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-stone-600">
            <li><strong>Monday:</strong> Chicken stir-fry with frozen vegetables and rice</li>
            <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Chicken quesadilla with cheese and salsa</li>
            <li><strong>Friday:</strong> Chicken fried rice with egg and soy sauce</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mt-3">
            One protein. Three completely different meals. Zero waste.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Same principle applies to vegetables. Buy a head of cabbage: use some in the
          stir-fry Monday, shred some for tacos Wednesday, saut&eacute; the rest as a
          side on Friday. A single head of cabbage lasts two months in the fridge and
          works in almost anything.

        Embrace Leftovers as Tomorrow&apos;s Lunch
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          This is the single best hack for cooking solo: <strong>always cook dinner
          for two</strong>. Eat one portion for dinner, pack the other for tomorrow&apos;s
          lunch.
        </p>
        <p>
          You&apos;re not making &quot;leftovers&quot; &mdash; you&apos;re making lunch.
          Reframing it this way changes everything. You&apos;re not eating old food.
          You&apos;re being efficient. Professional move.
        </p>
        <p>
          This solves two problems at once: you don&apos;t waste the second portion,
          and you don&apos;t have to figure out lunch. Most meals reheat perfectly:
          pasta, rice dishes, stir-fries, soups, anything with a sauce. Pack it in a
          container while you&apos;re cleaning up dinner and it&apos;s ready to grab
          in the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you hate reheated food, turn it into something new. Last night&apos;s
          grilled chicken becomes today&apos;s chicken wrap. Rice becomes fried rice.
          Roasted vegetables become a grain bowl with some cheese on top. Same
          ingredients, different meal, zero waste.

        The Real Cost of Food Waste When You Live Alone

        <p>
          Let&apos;s do the math. If you spend $80/week on groceries and waste 30%
          of it (the national average), that&apos;s $24/week going straight in the trash.
          That&apos;s <strong>$1,248 per year</strong> of food you bought, looked at,
          and threw away.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the strategies in this article &mdash; freezing portions, buying smart,
          overlapping ingredients, cooking for two and eating leftovers &mdash; you can
          realistically cut waste to under 10%. That&apos;s $16/week back in your pocket,
          or about $830/year.

        <p>
          Or you could skip the mental gymnastics entirely and use a meal plan that
