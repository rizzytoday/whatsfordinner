        <p>
          The real reason people don&apos;t cook isn&apos;t time. It&apos;s the
          15-ingredient recipe that needs a specialty store run, three spices you&apos;ll
          use once, and a &quot;quick&quot; prep step that somehow takes 45 minutes. You
          open the recipe, see the ingredient list, and close your laptop. DoorDash wins
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here&apos;s the thing: the best weeknight meals don&apos;t need 15
          ingredients. They need five good ones and 20 minutes.

            <strong>Frozen vegetables.</strong> Broccoli, peas, stir-fry mix. Cheaper

          <li>
            <strong>Cheese.</strong> A block of parmesan or a bag of shredded Mexican

        <p>
          Constraints breed creativity. When you limit yourself to five ingredients,
          something interesting happens: you actually cook. You don&apos;t spend
          30 minutes prepping. You don&apos;t abandon the recipe halfway through
          because it got complicated. You don&apos;t order takeout because the
          grocery list was too long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five ingredients means a shorter grocery list, less food waste, faster
          prep, and fewer dishes. It means you can{" "}
          <Link href="/blog/meal-planning-for-beginners" className="text-orange-500 underline">meal plan for the whole week</Link>{" "}
          in five minutes because there&apos;s less to think about. And when cooking
          is easy, you do it more often. That&apos;s the whole game.
