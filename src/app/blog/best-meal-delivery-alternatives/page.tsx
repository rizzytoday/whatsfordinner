      {/* --- Intro --- */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Meal delivery services like HelloFresh, Blue Apron, and Factor promised
          to solve the &ldquo;what&apos;s for dinner&rdquo; problem. And they
          did &mdash; at $8-12 per serving. For a family of four eating dinner
          five nights a week, that&apos;s $160-240 <em>per week</em>. Per month,
          you&apos;re looking at $640-960 just for dinners. That&apos;s more than
          most people&apos;s entire grocery budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dirty secret of meal delivery is that you&apos;re mostly paying for
          logistics. The ingredients themselves are the same ones sitting in your
          local grocery store for a fraction of the price. The value proposition
          is convenience &mdash; not having to decide what to cook or write a
          grocery list. But in 2026, there are much cheaper ways to get that same
          convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are 7 alternatives that solve the same problem without the
          premium price tag.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* --- #1 What's For Dinner --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        1. What&apos;s For Dinner &mdash; AI meal plan + grocery list ($7.99/mo)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          This is the closest thing to the meal delivery experience without the
          meal delivery price. What&apos;s For Dinner uses AI to generate a
          fully personalized weekly meal plan with recipes and a consolidated
          grocery list, delivered to your inbox every week. You set your dietary
          preferences, allergies, household size, and budget tier once, and a
          fresh plan shows up on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key difference from a meal kit: you shop at your own grocery
          store. The grocery list is organized by section (produce, dairy,
          proteins, pantry) so you&apos;re in and out quickly. The recipes are
          generated from scratch by AI &mdash; not pulled from a static
          database &mdash; so you get genuine variety week after week without
          repeats.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <strong>$7.99/month</strong>, it replaces the two most painful parts
          of cooking (deciding what to make and writing a grocery list) for less
          than the cost of a single HelloFresh serving. There&apos;s a free
          3-day trial with no signup required.

      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Mealime is the best free option for people who want to pick their own
          meals and get a grocery list. You browse their recipe library, select
          what you want to cook this week, and Mealime generates a consolidated
          shopping list. The step-by-step cooking instructions are clean and
          well-designed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The catch is that Mealime doesn&apos;t do the planning for you. You
          still have to decide what to cook every week, and the recipe library
          hasn&apos;t grown much in recent years. Free users hit the repetition
          wall quickly. Pro ($5.99/mo) unlocks more recipes and nutritional info,
          but you&apos;re still the planner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Best for: People who enjoy browsing recipes and don&apos;t mind doing
          the selection themselves. Not great for people who want hands-off
          planning.

      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Budget Bytes is a recipe website (not an app) that has been the go-to
          resource for budget-conscious cooking since 2009. Every recipe includes
          a per-serving cost breakdown, and the quality is genuinely excellent.
          These are meals people actually want to eat, not sad budget food.
          The entire recipe archive is free.
        </p>
        <p>
          They offer a meal plan subscription ($8/mo) that sends you weekly plans
          built from their recipes, but it&apos;s not personalized &mdash;
          everyone gets the same plan. There&apos;s no dietary customization, no
          allergy support, and no way to tailor plans to your household.
          The free recipe content is the real value here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Best for: Budget-focused cooks who enjoy browsing recipes and building
          their own plans. The free recipe archive alone is worth bookmarking.

      {/* --- #4 Rotisserie Strategy --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        4. Grocery store rotisserie strategy
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          This is the no-app, no-subscription alternative that busy families
          have been using for decades. The strategy is simple: buy a pre-cooked
          rotisserie chicken (or two) from the grocery store and build meals
          around it all week. Day one: chicken with roasted vegetables. Day two:
          chicken tacos. Day three: chicken fried rice. Day four: chicken soup
          from the bones. You get 4+ dinners from a $6-8 bird.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extend the concept beyond chicken. Most grocery stores sell pre-made
          sides, pre-cut vegetables, bagged salads, and deli items. You can
          assemble complete meals without cooking from scratch. The trade-off
          is variety &mdash; you&apos;re eating variations of the same protein
          all week. But the cost-per-meal is unbeatable, and the effort is
          minimal.
        </p>

          <p className="text-sm font-medium text-stone-700 mb-2">Cost:</p>

      {/* --- #5 Costco Meal Prep --- */}

        5. Costco meal prep (bulk buy + batch cook)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Costco (or Sam&apos;s Club, or any warehouse store) is a meal delivery
          alternative hiding in plain sight. Buy proteins in bulk &mdash; a
          10-pack of chicken thighs, a pork loin, ground beef in 5-lb
          tubes &mdash; and spend one afternoon portioning, seasoning, and
          freezing. Each weeknight, you pull a pre-prepped protein from the
          freezer, cook it, and pair it with a quick side. The per-serving
          cost drops to $2-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          The upfront time investment is real: you need 2-3 hours on a weekend
          to do the prep. You also need freezer space and containers. But once
          it&apos;s done, weeknight cooking takes 20-30 minutes. This approach
          works especially well when combined with a meal planning app that
          tells you <em>what</em> to cook each night &mdash; you handle the bulk
          prep, the app handles the decisions.

          gnocchi, and Indian simmer sauces are restaurant-quality at $3-5 per
          serving. Costco&apos;s frozen section has similar gems &mdash; their
          bibimbap bowls, chicken tikka masala, and ravioli lasagna are
          legitimately good.
        </p>
        <p>
          The upgrade strategy: use frozen mains as your base, then add a
          fresh side. Frozen orange chicken + steamed broccoli and rice. Frozen
          tikka masala + naan and a quick cucumber salad. You get 80% of the
          meal delivery convenience at 20% of the cost. The meal is on the
          table in 15-20 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn&apos;t meal planning &mdash; it&apos;s meal assembling. But
          for busy weeknights when you don&apos;t have the energy to cook from
          scratch, it&apos;s a smarter move than ordering DoorDash or
          subscribing to a $12/serving meal kit.

      {/* --- #7 Sunday Batch Cooking --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        7. Sunday batch cooking (cook 3, eat all week)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The batch cooking method is the OG meal delivery alternative. The
          idea: spend 2-3 hours on Sunday cooking 3 proteins (chicken thighs,
          ground turkey, salmon), 2 grains (rice, pasta), and 2-3 vegetables.
          Store everything in containers. Each weeknight, you mix and match
          components into different meals &mdash; chicken + rice + broccoli on
          Monday, turkey + pasta + roasted peppers on Tuesday, salmon bowls on
          Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beauty of this approach is that weeknight &ldquo;cooking&rdquo;
          takes 5-10 minutes. You&apos;re just reheating and plating. The
          Sunday session is the investment, and it pays off all week. Pair it
          with different sauces, spices, and toppings to keep things
          interesting &mdash; the same chicken becomes teriyaki chicken, chicken
          tacos, and chicken Caesar salad.
        </p>
        <p>
          The challenge is knowing <em>what</em> to batch cook each week. This
          is where a meal planning app becomes a force multiplier: it handles
          the recipe decisions, you handle the batch execution. Together, you
          get the convenience of meal delivery at a fraction of the cost.
