        Cooking for Your Partner: 10 Easy Meals That Look Fancy
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Cooking dinner for someone you&apos;re dating is one of the most
          attractive things you can do. Seriously. It beats any restaurant
          reservation. It&apos;s personal, it&apos;s thoughtful, it says
          &quot;I put effort into this evening&quot; &mdash; and it costs $15
          instead of $80.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, lowkey, it&apos;s a flex. There&apos;s something about watching
          someone move confidently around a kitchen that just hits different.
          Even if your &quot;confidence&quot; is secretly following a recipe
          on your phone propped behind the toaster.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here&apos;s the thing: you don&apos;t need to be good at cooking.
          You just need to pick the right recipe. These 10 meals LOOK like
          you spent hours, but every single one takes 30 minutes or less.
          The secret isn&apos;t skill &mdash; it&apos;s recipe selection.
        </p>

        The Secret: Restaurant Techniques Are Simple
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The gap between &quot;home cooking&quot; and &quot;restaurant
          food&quot; is way smaller than you think. Restaurants don&apos;t
          use secret ingredients or magic techniques. They use four things
          consistently, and you can copy all of them tonight:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>High heat.</strong> Most home cooks are afraid of heat.
            Restaurants blast it. A screaming hot pan is what gives you that
            golden sear on salmon, that crust on steak, that caramelization
            on vegetables. Don&apos;t be scared of a little smoke.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finish with butter.</strong> Almost every restaurant sauce
            gets a knob of butter stirred in right at the end. It adds
            richness and makes the sauce glossy. This one trick makes
            everything taste 40% more expensive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fresh herbs on top.</strong> A handful of chopped parsley,
            basil, or cilantro on top of a finished dish is the easiest
            visual upgrade. It adds color, freshness, and makes any plate
            look intentional instead of thrown together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Wipe the plate edge.</strong> Before you serve, take a
            paper towel and wipe any drips or smudges off the rim of the
            plate. This is what every chef does before a plate leaves the
            kitchen. It takes three seconds and makes the whole thing look
            polished.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That&apos;s it. Those four things are 80% of what makes food look
          and taste &quot;fancy.&quot; The recipe does the rest. You&apos;re
          not learning to be a chef &mdash; you&apos;re learning to pick
          the right recipe and plate it like you know what you&apos;re doing.

        Meal Plan Your Date Nights Into the Week

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s an underrated move: don&apos;t treat date night cooking
          as a one-off event. Build it into your weekly routine. When you{" "}

          , designate one night as your &quot;date night dinner.&quot; The
          rest of the week can be simple meals &mdash; stir fries, pasta,
          sheet pan dinners. But that one night, you pick something from
          this list and make it an event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beauty of this approach is that your grocery list already includes
          everything you need. You&apos;re not making a special trip to the
          store at 5 PM on Saturday trying to figure out what to cook. The
          salmon is already in the fridge. The herbs are already bought. The
          plan handled the logistics so you can focus on the experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          What&apos;s For Dinner plans include a mix of quick weeknight meals
          and more interesting recipes &mdash; perfect for designating one
          night as date night without any extra effort. One plan, one grocery
          run, one evening that feels special without the stress.
