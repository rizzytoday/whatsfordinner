          Budget Bytes has been a go-to for home cooks who want to eat well
          without draining their bank account. The cost-per-serving breakdowns,
          the step-by-step photos, the massive recipe archive — it&apos;s
          genuinely useful stuff. But here&apos;s the thing: it&apos;s still a
          blog. And a blog means <strong>you</strong> do all the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          You browse. You pick recipes. You cross-reference ingredients. You
          figure out portions for your household. You build your own grocery
          list. And you do it all over again next week. Budget Bytes gives you
          great raw material, but it doesn&apos;t plan your week for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What&apos;s For Dinner</strong> takes the opposite approach.
          Tell us your diet, allergies, household size, and budget — and
          our AI builds a complete personalized meal plan with a grocery list,
          delivered to your inbox every week. No browsing. No spreadsheets. No
          Sunday afternoon spent cobbling together a plan from blog posts.

        What is Budget Bytes?
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Budget Bytes is a recipe blog founded by Beth Moncel in 2009. Its
          signature feature is the cost-per-serving breakdown on every recipe
          — showing you exactly what each meal costs to make. The site has
          grown into a massive archive of budget-friendly recipes organized by
          category, cuisine, and cooking method.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s free to use, with some premium meal plan content available.
          The recipes are beginner-friendly with step-by-step photos, and
          there&apos;s a strong focus on meal prep guides and batch cooking.
          For anyone who enjoys browsing recipes and building their own plan,
          it&apos;s a solid resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          But &ldquo;browsing recipes and building your own plan&rdquo; is
          exactly where the friction lives. Budget Bytes is a library, not a
          planner. It tells you <em>what</em> you could cook — but not
          what you <em>should</em> cook this week based on your specific needs.
        </p>

            <strong>It&apos;s free</strong> — no paywall for the core

        </ul>

          Budget Bytes and What&apos;s For Dinner solve the same core problem

          The trade-off is straightforward: Budget Bytes is free but demands
          your time. What&apos;s For Dinner costs <strong>$4.99/month</strong>{" "}
          but gives you that time back. If you spend even 30 minutes a week
          browsing recipes and building a grocery list, you&apos;re paying for
          meal planning either way — just in hours instead of dollars.

          is a blog you can keep using whenever you want. Think of What&apos;s
          For Dinner as the layer that sits on top. Instead of spending your

          <li>
            <strong>List your allergies</strong> — the AI will strictly

          Budget Bytes is great at what it does. But what it does is give you
          recipes — the planning is still on you. Here&apos;s where
          What&apos;s For Dinner picks up where a recipe blog leaves off:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Complete plans, not just recipes
        </h3>
        <p>
          Budget Bytes gives you individual recipes. What&apos;s For Dinner
          gives you a structured weekly plan — breakfast, lunch, dinner,
          and optional snacks for every day, with a consolidated grocery list.
          No assembly required. You open your email and your entire week is
          mapped out.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Personalized to your household
        </h3>
        <p>
          Budget Bytes recipes use standard serving sizes. If you&apos;re
          cooking for one person or a family of six, you&apos;re doing the math
          yourself. What&apos;s For Dinner tailors every plan to your exact
          household size, dietary needs, allergies, and cuisine preferences.
          The AI doesn&apos;t just scale portions — it picks entirely
          different meals based on who&apos;s eating.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Budget tiers, not just cost labels
        </h3>
        <p>
          Budget Bytes shows you what each recipe costs. That&apos;s helpful,
          but you still have to filter and choose recipes that fit your weekly
          budget. What&apos;s For Dinner lets you set a budget tier —
          budget-friendly, moderate, or premium — and the AI builds your
          entire plan around that constraint. Every meal, every ingredient,
          every week.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Automatic grocery lists
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is the big one. Budget Bytes doesn&apos;t generate a grocery
          list for you. You read each recipe, note the ingredients, check
          what&apos;s already in your pantry, and build a list manually.
          What&apos;s For Dinner includes a{" "}

            consolidated grocery list
          </Link>{" "}
          with every weekly plan, organized and ready to take to the store.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Zero effort every week
        </h3>
        <p>
          With Budget Bytes, meal planning is a weekly project. You browse,
          bookmark, organize, and list-build every single week. With What&apos;s
          For Dinner, you set your preferences once and a fresh plan lands in
          your inbox every week. The only thing you do each week is open your
          email and go shopping.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Worth the $4.99
        </h3>
        <p>
          Budget Bytes is free, and that&apos;s a real advantage. But consider
          what your time is worth. If you spend 30-60 minutes a week planning
          meals from blog posts, that&apos;s 2-4 hours a month of
          planning time. At <strong>$4.99/month</strong>, What&apos;s For
          Dinner gives you all of that time back. It&apos;s not replacing the
          recipes — it&apos;s replacing the work of turning recipes into
          a plan. And you can{" "}
