        10 Ways to Upgrade Instant Ramen Into a Real Meal
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Instant ramen is the foundation of every broke person&apos;s diet.
          College students, first apartments, end-of-the-month budgets &mdash;
          we&apos;ve all been there. No shame in it. A pack costs $0.30, takes
          3 minutes, and fills the void in your stomach if not your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here&apos;s what nobody tells you: there&apos;s a massive gap
          between plain ramen (sad, sodium-heavy, nutritionally void) and
          actually good ramen (filling, flavorful, borderline impressive). And
          bridging that gap costs about $1 more and 2 extra minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          These 10 upgrades turn a depressing emergency meal into something
          you&apos;d genuinely choose to eat. Every single one costs under $2
          total per serving.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Why ramen is a great base */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Why Ramen Is Actually a Great Starting Point
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Before we get into the upgrades, let&apos;s appreciate what ramen
          actually is: a cheap, fast, blank canvas. The noodles are neutral. The
          broth is salty. That means anything you add to it becomes the star of
          the show. Think of instant ramen less as a complete meal and more as
          infrastructure &mdash; the noodles and broth are just the delivery
          system for whatever you throw in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seasoning packet is your friend, but you don&apos;t have to use
          all of it. Half a packet gives you enough flavor without turning your
          broth into a salt lick. Add your own seasonings on top and you&apos;re
          basically a chef. (You&apos;re not. But it&apos;ll taste like you are.)
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* The 10 upgrades */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The 10 Upgrades
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-6 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        {/* 1 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-2">
            1. The Egg Drop
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: 1 egg | Cost: ~$0.30 | Total: ~$0.60</p>
          <p>
            The classic. While your ramen is boiling, crack an egg directly into
            the pot and stir slowly. The egg cooks in ribbons through the broth,
            adding protein and making the whole thing feel like an actual meal.
            Don&apos;t overthink it &mdash; crack, stir, done. This is the
            upgrade with the highest effort-to-reward ratio in cooking history.
          </p>
        </div>
        {/* 2 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-2">
            2. Peanut Butter + Soy Sauce + Sriracha
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: 1 tbsp PB, soy sauce, sriracha | Cost: ~$0.40 | Total: ~$0.70</p>
          <p>
            This sounds weird until you try it, and then you make it three times
            a week. Drain most of the water (leave about 2 tablespoons), stir in
            a spoonful of peanut butter, a splash of soy sauce, and as much
            sriracha as you can handle. You just made budget pad thai. The
            peanut butter melts into a creamy sauce that coats every noodle. Life
            changing. Under a dollar.
          </p>
        </div>
        {/* 3 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-2">
            3. Frozen Veggies + Sesame Oil
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: 1/2 cup frozen stir-fry mix, sesame oil | Cost: ~$0.50 | Total: ~$0.80</p>
          <p>
            Dump half a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables into the pot 2 minutes
            before the noodles are done. They cook right in the broth. Finish
            with a few drops of sesame oil. Now you have vegetables in your
            ramen, which makes this technically a balanced meal. The sesame oil
            adds a nutty depth that makes the whole bowl smell like a real
            restaurant.
          </p>

        <div>

            4. Kimchi + Soft Boiled Egg
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: 2 tbsp kimchi, 1 soft-boiled egg | Cost: ~$0.80 | Total: ~$1.10</p>
          <p>
            This is the one that makes people think you know what you&apos;re
            doing. Boil an egg for 7 minutes (6.5 if you want it runny), peel
            it, cut it in half, and place it on top of your ramen. Add a few
            spoonfuls of kimchi. The fermented, spicy, tangy kimchi combined
            with a jammy egg yolk is genuinely restaurant-level. A jar of kimchi
            costs $5 and lasts two weeks.
          </p>

            5. Canned Chicken + Lime + Cilantro
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: 1/2 can chicken, lime, cilantro | Cost: ~$1.00 | Total: ~$1.30</p>
          <p>
            Drain half a can of chicken and toss it into your ramen. Squeeze in
            half a lime and throw in some cilantro if you have it (skip it if you
            don&apos;t, the lime does most of the work). This turns your ramen
            into something that tastes like a quick chicken pho. The acid from
            the lime cuts through the sodium and makes the whole thing taste
            fresh and bright.

          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: 2 slices American cheese, black pepper | Cost: ~$0.40 | Total: ~$0.70</p>
          <p>
            This is a Korean internet invention and it&apos;s genius. Cook your
            ramen, drain most of the water, lay two slices of American cheese on
            top, and microwave for 30 seconds until melted. Crack a bunch of
            black pepper on top. The cheese melts into a creamy, slightly tangy
            sauce. It shouldn&apos;t work. It absolutely works. Use American
            cheese specifically &mdash; it melts smoother than anything else.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-2">
            7. Coconut Milk + Curry Paste
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: 1/4 can coconut milk, 1 tsp curry paste | Cost: ~$0.80 | Total: ~$1.10</p>
          <p>
            Replace half the water with coconut milk before cooking. Add a
            teaspoon of red or green curry paste. Cook as normal. You just made
            coconut curry ramen for a dollar. The coconut milk makes the broth
            rich and creamy, and the curry paste adds warmth and complexity. A
            can of coconut milk is $1.50 and gives you 4 servings. Curry paste
            is $3 and lasts months.

            8. Leftover Rotisserie Chicken + Green Onion
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: shredded chicken, green onion | Cost: ~$0.70 | Total: ~$1.00</p>
          <p>
            If you bought a $5 rotisserie chicken from the grocery store (and
            you should &mdash; it&apos;s the best deal in any supermarket), shred
            some of it into your ramen. Slice a green onion on top. The pre-cooked
            chicken adds protein without any extra cooking, and the green onion
            adds color and a sharp bite that cuts through the richness. A single
            rotisserie chicken gives you 4-5 ramen servings worth of meat.
          </p>

        {/* 9 */}
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-800 mb-2">
            9. Fried Egg + Chili Oil + Everything Bagel Seasoning
          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: 1 egg, chili oil, everything seasoning | Cost: ~$0.50 | Total: ~$0.80</p>
          <p>
            Fry an egg in a little oil until the edges are crispy and the yolk
            is still runny. Place it on top of your drained ramen. Drizzle chili
            oil over everything and hit it with everything bagel seasoning. When
            you break the yolk, it mixes with the chili oil and noodles and
            creates the kind of meal that makes you close your eyes while eating.
            This is the most photogenic upgrade on the list, if you care about
            that sort of thing.

          </h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-400 mb-2">Add: 1 tbsp miso, tofu cubes, canned corn | Cost: ~$1.00 | Total: ~$1.30</p>
          <p>
            Skip the seasoning packet entirely. Instead, stir a tablespoon of
            miso paste into the hot broth (don&apos;t boil it &mdash; miso
            loses flavor at high heat, just stir it in after you turn off the
            heat). Add cubed tofu and a few spoonfuls of canned corn. This is
            basically miso ramen from scratch. Miso paste is $4 and lasts
            forever in the fridge. Tofu is $2 for 4 servings. Corn is $0.80
            a can.
