        10 Ways to Upgrade Instant Ramen Into a Real Meal
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Instant ramen is the foundation of every broke person&apos;s diet.
          College students, first apartments, end-of-the-month budgets &mdash;
          we&apos;ve all been there. No shame in it. A pack costs $0.30, takes
          3 minutes, and fills the void in your stomach if not your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here&apos;s what nobody tells you: there&apos;s a massive gap
          between plain ramen (sad, sodium-heavy, nutritionally void) and
          actually good ramen (filling, flavorful, borderline impressive). And
          bridging that gap costs about $1 more and 2 extra minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          These 10 upgrades turn a depressing emergency meal into something
          you&apos;d genuinely choose to eat. Every single one costs under $2
          total per serving.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Why ramen is a great base */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Why Ramen Is Actually a Great Starting Point
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Before we get into the upgrades, let&apos;s appreciate what ramen
          actually is: a cheap, fast, blank canvas. The noodles are neutral. The
          broth is salty. That means anything you add to it becomes the star of
          the show. Think of instant ramen less as a complete meal and more as
          infrastructure &mdash; the noodles and broth are just the delivery
          system for whatever you throw in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seasoning packet is your friend, but you don&apos;t have to use
          all of it. Half a packet gives you enough flavor without turning your
          broth into a salt lick. Add your own seasonings on top and you&apos;re
          basically a chef. (You&apos;re not. But it&apos;ll taste like you are.)
        </p>
