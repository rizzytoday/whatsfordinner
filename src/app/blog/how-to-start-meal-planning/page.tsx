      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          You&apos;ve tried meal planning before. You spent an hour on Sunday
          picking recipes, made a grocery list, cooked one meal, and by
          Wednesday you ordered pizza. Sound familiar?
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn&apos;t a willpower problem &mdash; it&apos;s a system
          problem. Most{" "}
          <Link href="/blog/meal-planning-for-beginners" className="text-orange-500 underline">meal planning advice</Link>{" "}
          tells you to plan every meal for 7 days, batch-prep on Sunday, and
          stick to the plan no matter what. That works for exactly nobody who
          has a real life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here&apos;s a simpler approach that actually sticks &mdash; even if
          every previous attempt ended with a guilty DoorDash order.
        </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The 3 Reasons Meal Planning Fails
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Before we fix the system, let&apos;s talk about why the old one
          didn&apos;t work. It almost always comes down to three things:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Too many recipes.</strong> Planning 7 unique dinners from
          scratch means 7 new recipes to learn, 30+ ingredients to buy, and
          hours of prep. By Tuesday you&apos;re already behind. The fix: plan
          fewer meals. Five is plenty. Two nights are for leftovers, eating
          out, or whatever you feel like.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. No flexible nights.</strong> Life happens. You work late,
          friends invite you out, you&apos;re just not in the mood for that
          stir-fry you planned. A rigid 7-day plan cracks the first time
          reality doesn&apos;t match the spreadsheet &mdash; and then you
          abandon the whole thing. Built-in flexibility isn&apos;t laziness.
          It&apos;s what makes the plan survivable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. The grocery list doesn&apos;t match the plan.</strong> You
          buy ingredients for ambitious recipes, then realize you also need
          spices you don&apos;t have, a kitchen tool you forgot about, or
          fresh produce that goes bad before you get to recipe #4. The
          solution: build your grocery list directly from your meal plan, not
          the other way around. And keep ingredients overlapping across meals
          so nothing gets wasted.
        </p>

        {/* Stat callout */}
        <div className="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-400 rounded-r-xl p-4 my-6">
          <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-800">5 dinners, not 7</p>
          <p className="text-sm text-stone-500 mt-1">The single biggest change that makes meal planning actually stick.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The Simple 5-Day System
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s the whole method. It takes 10 minutes, not an hour:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pick 3 base proteins for the week.</strong> Chicken, ground
          beef, and eggs. Or salmon, tofu, and sausage. Whatever you like.
          Three proteins means you&apos;re not buying 7 different meats, and
          you can use the same protein in multiple meals (chicken in tacos
          Monday, chicken stir-fry Thursday).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plan 5 dinners around those proteins.</strong> Keep them{" "}
          <Link href="/meal-plans/quick-30-minute-meal-plan" className="text-orange-500 underline">under 30 minutes</Link>{" "}
          and use ingredients you actually recognize. No truffle oil. No
          obscure spice blends. Just real food you can find at any grocery
          store.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Leave 2 nights completely open.</strong> These are your
          leftover nights, takeout nights, or &quot;I&apos;ll figure it
          out&quot; nights. They&apos;re not failures &mdash; they&apos;re
          part of the plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Write your grocery list from the meals.</strong> Go through
          each recipe, write down what you need, and cross off what you
          already have. That&apos;s it. No wandering the aisles hoping
          inspiration strikes. Your list matches your plan because it was
          built from your plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 2&ndash;3 weeks of this, you&apos;ll notice something: you
          keep coming back to the same 8&ndash;10 meals. That&apos;s not
          boring &mdash; that&apos;s your rotation forming. And a rotation is
          what separates people who meal plan for a week from people who meal
          plan for life.
