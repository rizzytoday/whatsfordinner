        EveryPlate Alternative: Even Cheaper Meal Planning
      </h1>

      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          EveryPlate is the budget king of meal kits. At around $5 per serving,
          it&apos;s HelloFresh&apos;s answer to people who loved the concept but
          couldn&apos;t stomach the price. Simpler recipes, fewer fancy
          ingredients, lower cost. If you want a meal kit that doesn&apos;t feel
          like a luxury purchase, EveryPlate is the obvious pick.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here&apos;s the uncomfortable truth: even at $5/serving,
          you&apos;re paying 2&ndash;3x what those same ingredients cost at your
          grocery store. Add the $10/week shipping fee and the reality that
          EveryPlate only covers 3 dinners, and the &quot;budget&quot; label
          starts looking less convincing. There&apos;s a way to eat planned meals
          every night for a fraction of even EveryPlate&apos;s prices.
        </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Why people are leaving EveryPlate
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          <strong>It&apos;s still more expensive than grocery shopping.</strong>{" "}
          EveryPlate&apos;s $5/serving sounds cheap next to HelloFresh&apos;s
          $10 — but compare it to buying groceries yourself. A home-cooked meal
          using grocery store ingredients costs $1.50&ndash;3.00 per serving.
          EveryPlate is double that, plus $10 shipping per box. For a couple
          doing 3 dinners/week, that&apos;s $70/month vs. $35&ndash;50 if you
          just bought the ingredients yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extremely limited variety.</strong> This is the real cost of
          being the budget option. EveryPlate offers just 8&ndash;10 recipes per
          week — compared to 30+ at HelloFresh. Within a month, you&apos;ve
          seen most of their repertoire. The meals are deliberately simple (think
          pasta, tacos, sheet pan chicken), which is fine at first but gets
          monotonous fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No dietary filters.</strong> Unlike even HelloFresh, EveryPlate
          has no keto, vegan, or allergy-specific plans. If you have dietary
          restrictions, you&apos;re manually scanning each week&apos;s menu and
          hoping 2&ndash;3 options work. For anyone with allergies, this is a
          dealbreaker.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The box problem persists.</strong> Budget pricing doesn&apos;t
          mean less packaging. You still get the insulated box, ice packs,
          individual ingredient bags, and plastic liners every single week. The
          environmental cost is identical to any meal kit.
        </p>
