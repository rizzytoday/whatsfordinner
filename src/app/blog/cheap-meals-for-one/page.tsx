          <Link href="/meal-plans/meal-plan-for-one" className="text-orange-500 underline">Cooking for one</Link> is weird. Every recipe serves four. Produce goes bad
          before you can eat it. And it&apos;s hard to motivate yourself to
          cook a &quot;real&quot; meal when it&apos;s just you. So you order
          a burrito for $12 instead, tell yourself it&apos;s fine, and do it
          again tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          But $12 a meal times 30 days is $360 a month. On just dinner.

        The Single-Person Grocery Problem
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The annoying reality of cooking for one: recipes are portioned for
          four, produce spoils before you use it, and buying small quantities
          costs more per unit. Here&apos;s how to deal with it:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Buy frozen vegetables.</strong> They&apos;re cheaper than
            fresh, they don&apos;t go bad, and they&apos;re already chopped.
            Frozen broccoli, stir-fry mix, peas, and corn are your best friends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use the same ingredients across meals.</strong> Chicken
            thighs show up in quesadillas, grain bowls, and sheet pan dinners.
            Black beans go in tacos, quesadillas, and baked potatoes. When
            ingredients overlap, nothing gets wasted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embrace leftovers.</strong> Cook for two (or four) on
            purpose and eat the rest for lunch or tomorrow&apos;s dinner. Chili,
            soup, and pasta all taste better the next day anyway.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Canned goods are your pantry backbone.</strong> Beans,
            tomatoes, tuna, corn &mdash; they&apos;re shelf-stable, cheap, and
            ready to use. No prep, no waste, no rush to eat them before they
            expire.
          </li>
