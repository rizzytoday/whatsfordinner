        Cheap Meals for One: 15 Dinners Under $3
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Cooking for one is weird. Every recipe serves four. Produce goes bad
          before you can eat it. And it&apos;s hard to motivate yourself to
          cook a &quot;real&quot; meal when it&apos;s just you. So you order
          a burrito for $12 instead, tell yourself it&apos;s fine, and do it
          again tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>
          But $12 a meal times 30 days is $360 a month. On just dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          These 15 meals cost $1.50-3 per serving, take under 30 minutes, and
          are genuinely good. Not &quot;good for the price&quot; &mdash;
          actually good. The kind of meals you&apos;d happily eat even if you
          had money to burn.
        </p>
      </div>

        5 No-Cook &amp; Assembly Meals
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          These barely count as cooking. If you can open cans and use a
          microwave, you&apos;re qualified.
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Black bean quesadillas</strong> &mdash; $1.75/serving, 8
            min. Tortilla, canned black beans (drained), shredded cheese. Fold,
            pan-fry until crispy. Add salsa if you&apos;re feeling fancy. Two
            quesadillas = a full meal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Peanut butter banana toast</strong> &mdash; $1.00/serving,
            3 min. Toast, peanut butter, sliced banana, drizzle of honey.
            Breakfast for dinner energy, zero shame required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tuna salad wrap</strong> &mdash; $2.50/serving, 5 min. Can
            of tuna, mayo, diced celery if you have it, salt and pepper. Wrap
            in a tortilla with some lettuce. Protein-packed and requires no
            heat source whatsoever.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Caprese-ish sandwich</strong> &mdash; $2.75/serving, 5 min.
            Bread, mozzarella slices, tomato, olive oil, salt. Italian vibes
            without the Italian restaurant prices. Add basil if you want to
            feel like a chef.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Microwave loaded potato</strong> &mdash; $2.00/serving, 10
            min. Poke a potato, microwave 5-8 minutes, split open, load with
            canned chili or black beans, cheese, sour cream. A full meal from
            one potato.
          </li>

        5 One-Pan Dinners
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          One pan, one burner, minimal cleanup. These are the meals that make
          you feel like you actually cooked something.
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 pl-1" start={6}>
          <li>
            <strong>Garlic butter pasta</strong> &mdash; $1.50/serving, 15 min.
            Boil pasta. In the same pan, melt butter with minced garlic (or
            garlic powder), toss pasta in it, add parmesan and red pepper
            flakes. This is the meal that proves expensive doesn&apos;t mean
            good.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Egg fried rice</strong> &mdash; $1.00/serving, 12 min.
            Leftover rice (or microwave rice), scramble eggs into it, add
            frozen peas, soy sauce, sesame oil if you have it. Better than
            takeout fried rice and it costs a dollar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chicken quesadillas</strong> &mdash; $2.50/serving, 12 min.
            Shred some cooked chicken (or use canned), load into a tortilla
            with cheese and whatever salsa or hot sauce you like. Pan-fry both
            sides until golden.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sausage and peppers</strong> &mdash; $3.00/serving, 20 min.
            Slice a couple of sausage links and a bell pepper. Cook in a pan
            with olive oil until everything is browned. Serve on rice or in a
            hoagie roll. Hearty and satisfying.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Black bean tacos</strong> &mdash; $1.75/serving, 10 min.
            Heat canned black beans with cumin and chili powder. Spoon into
            tortillas. Top with cheese, salsa, whatever you have. Three tacos
            and you&apos;re full for under two dollars.

          These meals cook themselves while you do literally anything else.
          Slow cooker, oven, or stovetop on low &mdash; dump everything in and
          come back later.
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 pl-1" start={11}>
          <li>
            <strong>Chili</strong> &mdash; $2.00/serving, 10 min prep. Can of
            kidney beans, can of diced tomatoes, ground beef or turkey, chili
            powder, cumin. Simmer on the stove for 30 minutes or dump in a
            slow cooker for 4 hours. Makes 4 servings, so you&apos;re eating
            for days.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Baked chicken thighs with rice</strong> &mdash;
            $2.50/serving, 10 min prep + 30 min oven. Season chicken thighs
            (salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika), bake at 400&deg;F for 25-30
            minutes. Serve over rice with frozen broccoli.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pasta e fagioli</strong> &mdash; $1.75/serving, 25 min.
            Basically Italian bean soup with pasta. Saut&eacute; garlic, add
            canned white beans, diced tomatoes, broth, small pasta. Simmer
            until pasta is cooked. Crusty bread on the side if you&apos;re
            splurging.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lentil soup</strong> &mdash; $1.50/serving, 10 min prep +
            30 min simmer. Dried lentils are stupidly cheap and they cook in 30
            minutes without soaking. Lentils + broth + canned tomatoes + cumin
            + whatever vegetables are dying in your fridge. Makes enough for
            3-4 meals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sheet pan sausage and vegetables</strong> &mdash;
            $2.75/serving, 10 min prep + 25 min oven. Slice sausage, cube
            potatoes, chop broccoli or zucchini. Toss everything with olive
            oil and seasoning. Bake at 400&deg;F. One pan, one meal, one dish
            to wash.

        The Single-Person Grocery Problem
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The annoying reality of cooking for one: recipes are portioned for
          four, produce spoils before you use it, and buying small quantities
          costs more per unit. Here&apos;s how to deal with it:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Buy frozen vegetables.</strong> They&apos;re cheaper than
            fresh, they don&apos;t go bad, and they&apos;re already chopped.
            Frozen broccoli, stir-fry mix, peas, and corn are your best friends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use the same ingredients across meals.</strong> Chicken
            thighs show up in quesadillas, grain bowls, and sheet pan dinners.
            Black beans go in tacos, quesadillas, and baked potatoes. When
            ingredients overlap, nothing gets wasted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embrace leftovers.</strong> Cook for two (or four) on
            purpose and eat the rest for lunch or tomorrow&apos;s dinner. Chili,
            soup, and pasta all taste better the next day anyway.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Canned goods are your pantry backbone.</strong> Beans,
            tomatoes, tuna, corn &mdash; they&apos;re shelf-stable, cheap, and
            ready to use. No prep, no waste, no rush to eat them before they
            expire.
          </li>
