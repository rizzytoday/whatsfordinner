          Cooklist is a solid app for tracking what&apos;s in your pantry and
          cutting down on food waste. But if what you really need is someone to
          tell you <strong>what to cook this week</strong> — not just what
          you already have in the fridge — you&apos;ve probably noticed
          that Cooklist&apos;s meal planning feels like an afterthought.
        </p>
        <p>
          That&apos;s because it is. Cooklist was built as a pantry and grocery
          management tool first. Meal planning was bolted on later. If you&apos;ve
          been searching for a Cooklist alternative that puts{" "}
          <strong>meal planning front and center</strong>, you&apos;re in the
          right place.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What&apos;s For Dinner</strong> takes a completely different
          approach. Instead of asking you to scan barcodes and manually track
          every item in your kitchen, it uses AI to generate a complete,
          personalized weekly meal plan with a grocery list — delivered
          straight to your inbox. Zero maintenance, zero scanning, zero effort.

        What is Cooklist?
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Cooklist is a grocery and pantry management app designed to help you
          reduce food waste. Its core idea is simple: scan the barcodes of
          everything you buy, and the app tracks what you have, when it expires,
          and suggests recipes based on your current inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also includes grocery list features, nutritional tracking, and some
          meal planning capabilities. The app has a free tier with premium
          features available for paid users.
        </p>
        <p>
          For people who are disciplined about scanning every item they bring
          home, Cooklist can be genuinely useful for reducing waste. But
          that&apos;s the catch — it only works if you keep scanning. The
          moment you skip a grocery trip, your pantry data goes stale and the
          recipe suggestions stop making sense.
        </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Food waste reduction</strong> — expiration date

          <li>
            <strong>Grocery list management</strong> — build and organize
            shopping lists within the app

          The key distinction: Cooklist plans meals around what you{" "}
          <strong>already have</strong>. What&apos;s For Dinner plans meals
          around what you <strong>actually want to eat</strong> — based on
          your dietary needs, cuisine preferences, household size, and budget.
          Then it gives you the exact grocery list to make it happen.

          One approach is reactive. The other is proactive. If you&apos;re tired
          of opening the fridge and trying to cobble together dinner from
          whatever&apos;s left, the proactive approach wins every time.

          Cooklist to track what&apos;s already in your kitchen. But most people

      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Cooklist and What&apos;s For Dinner have fundamentally different
          philosophies. Cooklist asks: &ldquo;What can I make with what I
          have?&rdquo; We ask: &ldquo;What should you eat this week?&rdquo;
          Here&apos;s why that matters:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Plans based on what you want, not what you have
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cooklist&apos;s recipe suggestions are limited by your current pantry
          inventory. If you&apos;re low on ingredients, the suggestions dry up.
          What&apos;s For Dinner generates a complete weekly plan based on your
          preferences, dietary needs, and budget — then gives you a
          grocery list so you can buy exactly what you need. You&apos;re never
          stuck making do with whatever&apos;s left in the cupboard.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Zero maintenance
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cooklist only works if you keep scanning. Every grocery trip, every
          new item, every time you use something up — you need to update
          the app. Miss a week, and your pantry data is wrong. Miss two weeks,
          and the whole system falls apart. What&apos;s For Dinner requires
          zero ongoing input. Set your preferences once, and a fresh meal plan
          arrives in your inbox every week automatically. No scanning, no
          logging, no upkeep.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          AI-generated plans, not database lookups
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cooklist matches your pantry contents against a database of existing
          recipes. What&apos;s For Dinner uses Claude AI to{" "}
          <strong>generate completely original meal plans</strong> every week,
          tailored to your exact dietary restrictions, allergies, cuisine
          preferences, and budget. You won&apos;t see the same rotation of
          meals on repeat — every week is genuinely new.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Deep dietary personalization
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cooklist offers basic dietary filters, but they&apos;re limited to
          preset categories. With What&apos;s For Dinner, you can type your
          restrictions in plain English — &ldquo;no nightshades, high
          protein, Mediterranean-style, under 30 minutes&rdquo; — and the
          AI understands all of it. No checkboxes. No compromises. The AI
          handles combinations that no preset filter system could cover.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Email delivery — no app needed
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cooklist requires you to open the app every time you want to see your
