        <p>
          Prepear built something genuinely useful &mdash; a meal planning app
          that connected you with food bloggers and their recipes, making it
          easy to discover new meals and organize your week. If you&apos;ve been
          using it, you know the appeal: browse recipes from creators you trust,
          drag them into a weekly plan, and generate a grocery list.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you&apos;re here, something about Prepear isn&apos;t quite
          working for you anymore. Maybe the free tier feels too limited. Maybe
          the recipes don&apos;t match your dietary needs closely enough. Or
          maybe you&apos;re tired of sifting through blogger content to find
          meals that actually fit your household.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What&apos;s For Dinner</strong> takes a fundamentally different
          approach. Instead of curating recipes from food bloggers, we use AI to
          generate meal plans that are personalized to your exact dietary
          restrictions, allergies, cuisine preferences, and budget &mdash; every
          single week, delivered straight to your inbox.
        </p>

        What is Prepear?
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Prepear is a meal planning and recipe sharing platform that connects
          users with food bloggers. The idea is simple: bloggers publish their
          recipes on Prepear, and you browse, save, and organize them into
          weekly meal plans. It&apos;s part recipe discovery engine, part meal
          planner, part social platform for food creators.
        </p>
        <p>
          The free tier gives you basic access to recipes and planning features,
          though it comes with ads and limitations. Premium plans run{" "}
          <strong>$4.99/month or $2.99/month billed annually</strong>, unlocking
          features like unlimited meal plans, advanced grocery lists, and
          family sharing. It&apos;s positioned as an affordable option for
          people who like browsing recipes from real creators rather than
          relying on a static database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prepear&apos;s strength is its content model &mdash; there&apos;s
          always fresh content flowing in from bloggers. But that same model is
          also its biggest limitation, which we&apos;ll get into.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prepear has a loyal user base, and for good reason. Here&apos;s what
          people genuinely appreciate about the platform:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Blogger-sourced recipes</strong> &mdash; discovering new
            meals from food creators you follow and trust, with real photos and
            tested instructions
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual meal planning</strong> &mdash; a clean drag-and-drop
            calendar interface that makes organizing your week feel intuitive
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recipe discovery</strong> &mdash; browsing by category,
            cuisine, or creator to find inspiration when you&apos;re stuck in a
            rut
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Family sharing</strong> &mdash; multiple household members
            can access the same plan and grocery list
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Affordable premium</strong> &mdash; at $2.99-$4.99/month,
            it&apos;s one of the cheaper meal planning apps on the market
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are real strengths. But if you need plans that are truly
          personalized to your dietary needs &mdash; not just a collection of
          recipes you manually pick &mdash; the model starts to show its limits.

          Prepear is a recipe platform with meal planning bolted on. What&apos;s
          For Dinner is a meal planning service built from the ground up with
          AI. Here&apos;s where that distinction matters:
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          AI-generated plans, not blogger recipes
        </h3>
        <p>
          Prepear&apos;s recipes come from food bloggers. That means quality
          varies wildly &mdash; some recipes are meticulously tested, others are
          thrown together for content. And because bloggers write for broad
          audiences, their recipes rarely account for your specific dietary
          needs. What&apos;s For Dinner uses Claude AI to{" "}
          <strong>generate original recipes tailored to you</strong> every week.
          Every meal considers your restrictions, allergies, preferences, and
          budget. No more scrolling through hundreds of recipes hoping one fits.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          True dietary intelligence
        </h3>
        <p>
          Prepear lets you filter recipes by category &mdash; &ldquo;gluten
          free&rdquo; or &ldquo;vegan&rdquo; &mdash; but that&apos;s a blunt
          instrument. What if you&apos;re pescatarian with a tree nut allergy
          who avoids nightshades? Good luck filtering for that. Our AI
          understands complex, overlapping dietary needs in plain English and
          generates plans that respect all of them simultaneously, without you
          having to check every ingredient list yourself.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Budget-aware meal planning
        </h3>
        <p>
          Prepear doesn&apos;t factor cost into meal planning &mdash; a blogger
          recipe might call for high-end ingredients whether you can afford them
          or not. What&apos;s For Dinner lets you choose between budget-friendly,
          moderate, and premium tiers. The AI adjusts ingredient choices
          accordingly, so you get meals that match both your diet and your
          wallet.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Email delivery &mdash; no app needed
        </h3>
        <p>
          Prepear lives in an app. That means another login, another thing to
          keep updated, another platform holding your data. We send your{" "}

          straight to your inbox every week. Open it on your phone at the
          grocery store, forward it to your partner, or print it out for the
          fridge. No app required, no platform lock-in.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-stone-700 mt-6">
          Consistent quality every week
        </h3>
        <p>
          When your recipes come from hundreds of different bloggers, consistency
          is impossible. One recipe might be brilliant, the next might be a dud.
          With AI-generated plans, every recipe follows the same quality
          standards &mdash; clear instructions, balanced nutrition, and
          ingredients that actually work together across your entire week. No
          more roulette.
