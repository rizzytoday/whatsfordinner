        How to Eat Well When You&apos;re Going Through It
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          When life gets heavy, eating well is the first casualty. You skip
          meals, survive on delivery and snacks, eat cereal at 11 PM standing
          over the sink. Not because you&apos;re lazy or don&apos;t care about
          your health &mdash; but because decision-making takes energy you
          don&apos;t have right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe you&apos;re dealing with depression, burnout, grief, anxiety, a
          breakup, a move, a job loss, or just a stretch of time where
          everything feels harder than it should. Whatever it is &mdash; you
          still need to eat. And &quot;just cook a healthy meal&quot; is advice
          that completely misses the point when getting out of bed is the
          accomplishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn&apos;t a &quot;get your life together&quot; lecture. There
          are no smoothie bowls with edible flowers. These are simple, honest
          ways to feed yourself when cooking feels impossible &mdash; organized
          by how much energy you actually have.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Zero-effort tier */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The Zero-Effort Tier
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          These meals require no cooking, no prep, and almost no decisions.
          Open, eat, done. If this is all you can manage right now, that&apos;s
          okay. <strong>These count. These are real meals.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>Yogurt + granola (or just yogurt, that&apos;s fine too)</li>
          <li>Apple slices + peanut butter</li>
          <li>Cheese + crackers + deli meat</li>
          <li>Cereal with milk</li>
          <li>Pre-made salad kit (the bagged ones, already dressed)</li>
          <li>Rotisserie chicken straight from the store</li>
          <li>A banana and a handful of nuts</li>
          <li>String cheese and grapes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Nobody needs to chop, saut&eacute;, or follow a recipe to eat. If
          you ate one of these today, you fed yourself. That matters more than
          you think.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The 5-Minute Tier
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          For the days when you have a tiny bit more capacity &mdash; enough
          to turn on a stove or a microwave but not enough for anything that
          involves more than three steps.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>Toast with avocado and everything bagel seasoning</li>
          <li>Quesadilla &mdash; tortilla + cheese in a pan, fold, done</li>
          <li>Scrambled eggs (two eggs, butter, pan, three minutes)</li>
          <li>Instant oatmeal with a sliced banana</li>
          <li>Peanut butter and jelly sandwich</li>
          <li>A frozen meal &mdash; no shame, zero shame, they exist for a reason</li>
          <li>Ramen with an egg cracked into it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The bar here is not &quot;nutritionally perfect.&quot; The bar is
          &quot;I ate warm food today.&quot; That&apos;s a win.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* 15-minute tier */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The 15-Minute Tier (for Better Days)
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          These are for when you have a little more in the tank. Not a lot
          &mdash; just enough to stand in the kitchen for 15 minutes without
          it feeling like a marathon. Save these for the days that feel slightly
          more manageable.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Pasta with jarred sauce.</strong> Boil water, cook pasta,
            pour sauce on top. Add parmesan if you have it. This is a complete
            meal and nobody can tell you otherwise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rice bowl with whatever protein you have.</strong> Leftover
            chicken, canned beans, a fried egg &mdash; pile it on rice with
            some hot sauce or soy sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Grilled cheese + canned soup.</strong> A classic comfort
            meal that&apos;s ready in the time it takes the soup to heat up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stir-fry with frozen vegetables.</strong> Frozen stir-fry
            mix + any protein + soy sauce + rice. One pan, no chopping.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Loaded toast.</strong> Toast with ricotta and honey, or
            cream cheese and smoked salmon, or peanut butter and banana. When
            toast is the foundation, anything works.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The 15-minute tier isn&apos;t about ambition. It&apos;s about having
          a few go-to meals that feel nourishing without requiring you to think
          too hard about them. If you cooked one of these, you did something
          really good for yourself today.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>
          The hardest part of eating when you&apos;re struggling isn&apos;t the
          cooking &mdash; it&apos;s the deciding. And if the fridge is empty,
          the decision becomes even harder because now you have to go to the
          store first. That&apos;s two executive function hurdles stacked on
          top of each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fix: keep a shelf (or a corner of your fridge) permanently
          stocked with things that require zero planning. Buy these once, and
          you always have something to eat:

        You Don&apos;t Have to Figure This Out Alone
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s the thing about feeding yourself when you&apos;re
          struggling: the hardest part isn&apos;t the cooking. It&apos;s all
          the invisible work that comes before it &mdash; deciding what to eat,
          figuring out what to buy, remembering to go to the store, mustering
          the energy to do any of it. Each step is a decision, and when
          you&apos;re running on empty, decisions are the most expensive
          currency you have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meal planning removes the decision entirely. When a plan just shows
          up with exactly what to buy and exactly what to cook, it&apos;s one
          less thing your brain has to process. You don&apos;t have to browse
          recipes. You don&apos;t have to build a grocery list. You don&apos;t
          have to stand in front of the fridge at 7 PM trying to assemble
          dinner from three random ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          That&apos;s not laziness. That&apos;s recognizing that your energy
          is limited right now and choosing to spend it on things that matter
          more &mdash; like getting through the day, taking care of yourself,
          or just resting.
