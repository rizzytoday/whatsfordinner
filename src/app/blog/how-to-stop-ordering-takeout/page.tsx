        How to Stop Ordering Takeout Every Night
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          You&apos;ve had this conversation with yourself before. Probably
          this week. &quot;I need to stop ordering food. I&apos;m going to
          cook more. Starting Monday.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Monday comes. You get home at 7 PM. You&apos;re tired. The fridge
          has condiments and half a bag of spinach that&apos;s seen better days.
          You open DoorDash &quot;just to see what&apos;s around.&quot; Twenty
          minutes and $22 later, you&apos;re eating pad thai on the couch,
          feeling a mix of satisfaction and guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          You&apos;re not lazy. You&apos;re not bad with money. You&apos;re
          just making a high-stakes decision (what to eat) at the worst
          possible time (when you&apos;re already hungry and exhausted). That&apos;s
          a game you&apos;ll lose every single time. The fix isn&apos;t
          willpower &mdash; it&apos;s removing the decision entirely.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Why you keep ordering takeout */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Why You Keep Ordering Takeout
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          It&apos;s not because you love spending $20 on mid food. It&apos;s
          because of three things happening at the same time:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Decision fatigue.</strong> By 7 PM, you&apos;ve made
            hundreds of decisions at work. Your brain is done deciding things.
            &quot;What&apos;s for dinner?&quot; is one more decision and your
            brain takes the path of least resistance: let someone else figure
            it out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You don&apos;t know what&apos;s in the fridge.</strong> Even
            if you wanted to cook, you&apos;d have to open the fridge, assess
            what&apos;s there, figure out what you can make with it, and then
            actually cook it. That&apos;s three steps before you even start.
            DoorDash is one tap.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cooking feels like a chore.</strong> Because without a plan,
            it IS a chore. You&apos;re not just cooking &mdash; you&apos;re also
            meal planning, recipe hunting, and grocery assessing in real-time
            while your stomach growls. No wonder it feels like too much.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Notice what&apos;s missing from that list? Discipline. It&apos;s not a
          character flaw. It&apos;s a systems problem. And systems problems have
          systems solutions.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* The one thing that actually works */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        The One Thing That Actually Works
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Having a plan <em>before</em> you&apos;re hungry. That&apos;s literally it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you already know what&apos;s for dinner and the ingredients are
          sitting in your fridge, the equation flips. Cooking becomes the path
          of least resistance. You don&apos;t have to decide anything &mdash;
          you just execute. Open the plan, pull out the ingredients, cook for
          15-20 minutes, eat.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s actually faster than ordering. A DoorDash order takes 30-45
          minutes from tap to first bite. A simple stir-fry takes 15 minutes.
          Pasta with sauce takes 12 minutes. A quesadilla takes 8 minutes.
          When everything&apos;s prepped and ready, cooking beats delivery on
          speed every single time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key insight: <strong>you make the food decision on Sunday, when
          you&apos;re rested and fed and thinking clearly.</strong> Not on
          Tuesday at 7 PM when you&apos;re running on fumes. Sunday-you is
          smart and motivated. Tuesday-you just needs to follow instructions.
        </p>

        The Math That Hurts
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Let&apos;s make this concrete. Say you order takeout 5 nights a week
          (which is common &mdash; no judgment):
        </p>
        <div className="overflow-x-auto my-4">
          <table className="w-full text-sm text-left border border-stone-200 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">

              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody className="divide-y divide-stone-100">
              <tr>
                <td className="px-4 py-3 font-medium text-stone-700">Takeout (5x/week @ $20 avg)</td>
                <td className="px-4 py-3">$100</td>

                <td className="px-4 py-3 text-red-500 font-semibold">$4,800</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td className="px-4 py-3 font-medium text-stone-700">Meal planning (all meals)</td>
                <td className="px-4 py-3">$50-75</td>

                <td className="px-4 py-3 text-green-600 font-semibold">$2,400-3,600</td>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>
          And that&apos;s the conservative math &mdash; $20 per takeout order is
          on the low end once you add delivery fees, service fees, and tip. Many
          people are spending $25-30 per order, which pushes the yearly takeout
          total past $6,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, $50-75/week in groceries covers <em>all</em> your meals.
          Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Not just dinner.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* Start with just 3 nights */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        Start with Just 3 Nights
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Here&apos;s where most advice gets it wrong: they tell you to go from
          ordering takeout every night to cooking every night. That&apos;s like
          going from zero gym sessions to six per week. You&apos;ll last three
          days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, start with 3 planned dinners this week. Pick the three
          easiest meals you can think of:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>Monday: Pasta with jarred sauce (12 minutes)</li>
          <li>Wednesday: Chicken quesadillas (10 minutes)</li>
          <li>Friday: Stir-fry with frozen veggies (15 minutes)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The other four nights? Do whatever you want. Order food, eat out with
          friends, make a sandwich, eat cereal. It doesn&apos;t matter. You&apos;re
          not trying to be perfect. You&apos;re trying to build a habit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next week, add a fourth night. The week after, a fifth. Within a
          month, you&apos;ll be cooking most nights not because you forced
          yourself, but because you realized it&apos;s actually easier when
          you have a plan. And the $100+ you&apos;re saving each month doesn&apos;t
          hurt either.

          that 20-30 minutes of planning is the friction that kills the habit.
