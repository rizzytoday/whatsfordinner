        Your First Grocery List: The New Apartment Starter Kit
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          You moved in. The kitchen has a stove, a microwave, and maybe a pan
          that the previous tenant left behind. The fridge is empty except for
          a box of baking soda and existential dread. You need to buy food, but
          you&apos;ve never actually stocked a kitchen from scratch and the
          grocery store has 40,000 items.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is your list. Not a Pinterest-optimized, aspirational pantry
          guide with 47 artisan spices. Just the actual stuff you need to cook
          actual food in your first week. Two shopping categories, under $60
          total, and 5 meals you can make with just these ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&apos;re assuming you have a stove, a pan, a pot, and basic utensils.
          If you don&apos;t even have that yet, grab a nonstick skillet ($15),
          a medium pot ($12), and a spatula ($3) from Target or Walmart. That&apos;s
          your entire kitchen toolkit for now.
        </p>
      </div>

          These are the things you buy once and don&apos;t replace for weeks or
          months. They&apos;re the backbone of every meal you&apos;ll cook.
          This is not the exciting part of the grocery trip, but it&apos;s the
          most important.

            1. Garlic Butter Pasta with Broccoli (15 min)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Boil pasta. While it cooks, melt butter in the pan, add garlic
            powder, toss in frozen broccoli for 3 minutes. Drain pasta, throw
            it in the pan, stir everything together. Salt, pepper, done. This
            will become your go-to &quot;I&apos;m tired and don&apos;t want to
            think&quot; dinner. It&apos;s also shockingly good for how simple
            it is.

            2. Chicken Stir-Fry with Rice (20 min)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Start rice. Cut chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces, season with
            salt and garlic powder, cook in oil until browned (8-10 min). Add
            frozen stir-fry vegetables and a splash of soy sauce. Serve over
            rice. Hot sauce on top if you want. This is the meal that teaches
            you the fundamental skill of cooking: protein + vegetable + grain +
            sauce = dinner.

            3. Egg Fried Rice (10 min)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Use leftover rice from last night (cold rice fries better than fresh).
            Heat oil in a pan, scramble 2 eggs, push them to the side. Add rice,
            soy sauce, frozen veggies. Stir everything together for 3 minutes
            on high heat. This is a 10-minute meal that costs about $1.50 and
            tastes like you ordered in. The secret is high heat and not stirring
            too much &mdash; let the rice get a little crispy on the bottom.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Chop up leftover chicken (or cook some fresh, 8 min). Put a
            tortilla in a dry pan on medium heat, add cheese and chicken to one
            half, fold it over. Cook 2-3 minutes per side until the cheese
            melts and the tortilla is golden and crispy. Serve with hot sauce.
            This is the fastest real meal you can make. Two quesadillas and
            you&apos;re full.

            5. Breakfast Burritos (8 min)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Scramble 2-3 eggs with salt and pepper. Warm a tortilla, add eggs,
            cheese, and hot sauce. Roll it up. That&apos;s breakfast. Or lunch.
            Or a 1 AM snack. Breakfast burritos work at any hour and cost about
            $0.80 each. If you have leftover chicken, throw some in. If you
            diced an onion, saut&eacute; some first. It&apos;s endlessly
            customizable.

        What You DON&apos;T Need Yet
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The internet will try to convince you that a properly stocked kitchen
          needs 30+ items. Ignore that. Here&apos;s what you can skip for now:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>A full spice rack.</strong> You have salt, pepper, and
            garlic powder. That covers 80% of meals. Buy individual spices only
            when a specific recipe calls for them. Cumin will probably be next.
            Then paprika. That&apos;s it for month one.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fancy oils.</strong> You don&apos;t need sesame oil, truffle
            oil, avocado oil, or extra virgin olive oil right now. One bottle
            of regular cooking oil handles everything. Upgrade later when you
            start caring about flavor profiles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gadgets.</strong> No air fryer. No Instant Pot. No rice
            cooker. No garlic press. A pan, a pot, and a spatula cook everything
            on this list. Buy gadgets after you&apos;ve been cooking consistently
            for a month and know what would actually save you time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fresh herbs.</strong> Cilantro, basil, and parsley are great
            but they die in 3 days and cost $2 a bunch. For now, dried garlic
            powder is your herb. Fresh herbs are a level-up, not a starter item.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multiple proteins.</strong> You have chicken and eggs.
            That&apos;s two proteins. That&apos;s enough. Ground beef, fish,
            tofu, and pork can join the rotation in week 3 when you&apos;re
            more comfortable.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal of week one isn&apos;t to build a dream kitchen. It&apos;s to
          prove to yourself that you can cook real food with basic ingredients.
          Everything else is an upgrade that comes later.

          You survived week one. The kitchen didn&apos;t burn down. You made
          actual food. Now you can start expanding. Here&apos;s the suggested
          order for building out your kitchen over the next month:

        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Week 2:</strong> Add ground beef ($5), a second frozen veg
            variety ($1.50), and cumin ($2). Now you can make tacos, meat sauce
            pasta, and beef fried rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Week 3:</strong> Add canned beans ($2.50), peanut butter
            ($3), and limes ($1). Beans add cheap protein, PB is snacks and
            sauces, lime makes everything taste fresh.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Week 4:</strong> Add whatever you&apos;ve been craving. By
            now you know what meals you actually cook and can buy ingredients to
            match your habits instead of someone else&apos;s list.

        The Part Nobody Talks About
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Your first few meals will be mediocre. That&apos;s normal. Cooking is
          a skill, not a talent &mdash; which means it gets better with
          repetition, not inspiration. The eggs will be overcooked. The rice
          might be mushy. The chicken might be dry the first time (it
          won&apos;t be with thighs, but still).
        </p>
        <p>
          That&apos;s fine. A mediocre home-cooked meal still costs $2 and
          takes 15 minutes. A mediocre Uber Eats order costs $18 and takes 45.
          Even your worst attempt is a better deal than delivery. And by meal
          number 10, you&apos;ll be genuinely good at the basics. By meal 30,
          you&apos;ll wonder why you ever thought cooking was hard.
