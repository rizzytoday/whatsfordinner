      {/* --- Intro --- */}
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Most grocery list apps are glorified note apps with a food theme.
          You type items, you check them off. That&apos;s it. The problem
          isn&apos;t writing the list &mdash; it&apos;s <em>building</em> the
          list. Figuring out what you need for the week, consolidating
          ingredients across multiple recipes, and organizing everything so
          you&apos;re not zigzagging across the store. That&apos;s where most
          apps fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          A genuinely useful grocery list app does three things: it generates
          the list from your meal plan or recipes, it consolidates duplicate
          ingredients (one entry for &ldquo;2 lbs chicken thighs&rdquo;
          instead of three separate entries from three recipes), and it
          organizes items by store section so you shop efficiently. We tested
          every major option in 2026 to find the ones that actually deliver
          on this promise.
        </p>
      </div>

      {/* --- #1 What's For Dinner --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        1. What&apos;s For Dinner &mdash; Best auto-generated grocery list
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          What&apos;s For Dinner takes a fundamentally different approach. You
          don&apos;t build a grocery list &mdash; one is built for you. The
          app uses AI to generate a personalized weekly meal plan with recipes,
          and automatically creates a consolidated grocery list organized by
          store section: produce, dairy, proteins, pantry staples, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consolidation is the killer feature. If three recipes call for
          onions, you see &ldquo;Onions (3)&rdquo; &mdash; not three separate
          onion entries. If two recipes use chicken thighs, the quantities are
          combined. The list also separates &ldquo;key buys&rdquo; (things
          you probably need to purchase) from &ldquo;pantry staples&rdquo;
          (things you likely already have), so you can skip items you already
          have on hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <strong>$7.99/month</strong>, you&apos;re getting a meal planner,
          recipe generator, <em>and</em> grocery list app in one. There&apos;s
          a free 3-day trial with no signup required.

        2. AnyList &mdash; Best standalone list app
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          AnyList is the Swiss Army knife of grocery list apps. It handles
          shared lists (multiple family members can add and check off items in
          real time), recipe importing from URLs, ingredient-to-list adding,
          and basic meal planning with a drag-and-drop calendar. The free tier
          covers basic lists. AnyList Complete ($12/year) unlocks recipe
          importing, store-specific organization, and cross-device sync.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipe import feature is where AnyList shines. Paste a recipe
          URL, and it extracts ingredients into a clean list that you can add
          to your shopping list with one tap. It handles quantity consolidation
          reasonably well, though not perfectly &mdash; you sometimes end up
          with both &ldquo;1 cup milk&rdquo; and &ldquo;2 cups milk&rdquo; as
          separate entries. The shared list feature is excellent for couples
          and families who split grocery shopping duties.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        3. Mealime &mdash; Best free recipe-to-list app
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Mealime&apos;s grocery list is the best free option if you want a
          list generated from recipes rather than typed manually. You browse
          their recipe library, select what you want to cook this week, and
          Mealime creates a consolidated grocery list. Ingredients are
          combined across recipes and organized into categories. The list is
          smart enough to skip things you likely already have (oil, salt,
          basic spices).
        </p>
        <p>
          The limitation is that the recipe library hasn&apos;t grown much.
          After a few months, you&apos;re cycling through the same meals,
          which means the same grocery list. Pro ($5.99/mo) adds nutritional
          info and more recipes, but the core selection issue remains. If
          you&apos;re happy picking from a fixed set of recipes, the grocery
          list feature works well. If you want fresh ideas every week,
          you&apos;ll outgrow it.

        4. OurGroceries &mdash; Best for family sharing
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          OurGroceries is the simplest option on this list, and that&apos;s
          its strength. It&apos;s a shared grocery list that syncs instantly
          across family members&apos; phones. One person adds &ldquo;milk&rdquo;
          at home, and it appears on the other person&apos;s phone at the
          store. When someone checks off an item, it disappears for everyone.
          No setup, no learning curve, no recipes &mdash; just a synced list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app remembers your previous items and categories, so after a
          few weeks of shopping, adding items becomes almost instant &mdash;
          start typing and it auto-suggests. You can create multiple lists
          (Costco, weekly groceries, Target run) and organize by category.
          The free version has ads but is fully functional. Premium ($5.99
          one-time) removes ads and adds photos.
        </p>
        <p>
          OurGroceries doesn&apos;t generate lists from recipes or meal plans.
          You&apos;re still typing everything manually. But if your main
          problem is coordination (not planning), it solves that perfectly.

      {/* --- #5 Apple/Google Reminders --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-stone-800 mt-10 mb-4">
        5. Apple/Google Reminders &mdash; Free and already on your phone
      </h2>
      <div className="space-y-4 text-stone-600 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The grocery list app you already have is the one built into your
          phone. Apple Reminders (iPhone) and Google Keep or Google Tasks
          (Android) both work perfectly fine as grocery lists. You can create
          a &ldquo;Groceries&rdquo; list, add items, check them off at the
          store, and share the list with family members. On Apple devices, you
          can add items via Siri (&ldquo;Hey Siri, add eggs to my grocery
          list&rdquo;). On Android, Google Assistant does the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          These apps don&apos;t consolidate ingredients, organize by aisle, or
          connect to recipes. They&apos;re just lists. But for people whose
          main frustration is forgetting items at the store, they solve that
          problem for free, with no extra app to install. And the voice
          integration means you can add items the moment you notice
          you&apos;re running low &mdash; hands-free, while cooking.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want &ldquo;just a list,&rdquo; you already have one. If you
          want a list that&apos;s <em>built</em> for you from a meal plan,
          you need one of the other options above.

          generate the list (from a meal plan or recipe selection) save
          dramatically more time than apps that just let you type items.
          The act of figuring out what you need for the week is the hard
          part. Checking items off at the store is easy.

          generates a list from your meal plan, organizes it by store section,
          and sends it to you. You walk into the store, follow the list, and
          walk out. No browsing, no deciding, no forgetting. That&apos;s the
          difference between a list app and a{" "}
