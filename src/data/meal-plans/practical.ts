The key is building meals around affordable staples — rice, beans, eggs, frozen vegetables, chicken thighs and drumsticks, canned goods — and avoiding processed convenience foods that eat up budget fast.",

Our plans combine these throughout the week to hit 70-100g protein daily without expensive cuts of meat or protein powders.",

        question: "What about fresh produce on a tight budget?",
        answer:
          "We mix frozen and fresh strategically. Frozen broccoli, peas, and spinach are just as nutritious as fresh and cost half as much. For fresh, we stick to what's in season and affordable — bananas, carrots, cabbage, onions, and whatever's on sale. The grocery list flags which items have good frozen alternatives.",

We also vary cooking methods — same ingredients roasted, stir-fried, or in soup taste completely different.",
