        question: "What foods cause inflammation?",
        answer:
          "The biggest dietary drivers of inflammation are refined sugar, processed seed oils (soybean, corn, canola), trans fats, excessive alcohol, processed meats, and refined carbohydrates like white bread and pastries. Our plans minimize all of these while focusing on whole, unprocessed foods.",
      },
      {
        question: "How quickly will I notice results from an anti-inflammatory diet?",
        answer:
          "Most people notice improvements in energy and digestion within 2-3 weeks. Joint pain and skin improvements typically take 4-8 weeks. Measurable changes in inflammatory markers like CRP can show up in blood work after 2-3 months of consistent eating.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is this the same as the Mediterranean diet?",
        answer:
          "Our anti-inflammatory plan overlaps significantly with the Mediterranean diet — both emphasize fish, olive oil, vegetables, and whole grains. The main difference is that our plan more actively eliminates inflammatory foods and includes specific anti-inflammatory ingredients like turmeric and ginger at higher frequency.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can an anti-inflammatory diet help with autoimmune conditions?",
        answer:
          "Many people with autoimmune conditions report symptom improvement on anti-inflammatory diets. While diet alone doesn't cure autoimmune diseases, reducing inflammatory triggers through food can complement medical treatment. Always work with your healthcare provider.",
