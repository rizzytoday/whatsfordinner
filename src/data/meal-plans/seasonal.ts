          "It works through multiple mechanisms: olive oil and fish reduce inflammation and improve cholesterol ratios, fiber from whole grains and legumes lowers LDL cholesterol, antioxidants from fruits and vegetables protect blood vessels, and the overall pattern reduces blood pressure. The PREDIMED study showed a 30% reduction in major cardiovascular events.",

        question: "How much fish should I eat per week?",
        answer:
          "Our plans include fish 2-3 times per week, in line with American Heart Association recommendations. We emphasize fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines for their high omega-3 content. If you don't eat fish, we include plant-based omega-3 sources like walnuts, flaxseed, and chia.",

      {
        question: "Is olive oil really that important?",
        answer:
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet's heart benefits. It's rich in polyphenols and monounsaturated fats that actively lower LDL cholesterol and reduce inflammation. Our plans use EVOO as the primary cooking fat and in dressings — typically 2-4 tablespoons per day.",

      {
        question: "Can I still eat red meat?",
        answer:
          "Yes, but sparingly — our plans include red meat about once per week at most. The emphasis shifts toward fish, poultry, legumes, and eggs as primary protein sources. When red meat does appear, it's lean cuts in moderate portions.",

      {
        question: "Will this help lower my cholesterol?",
        answer:
          "The Mediterranean diet is one of the most effective dietary approaches for improving cholesterol levels. The combination of olive oil, fish, nuts, and fiber-rich foods typically raises HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol. Many people see measurable improvements within 3-6 months.",

      "Managing diabetes through diet doesn't mean eliminating all carbs — it means choosing the right ones in the right amounts. Our low-carb diabetes plans keep net carbs moderate (50-100g per day), focus on low-glycemic ingredients, and distribute carbs evenly across meals to prevent blood sugar spikes and crashes. Every recipe is designed for steady energy, stable readings, and food you genuinely enjoy eating day after day.",

        answer:
          "Our diabetes-focused plans target 50-100g of net carbs per day, distributed evenly across meals. This is moderate low-carb — restrictive enough to improve blood sugar control but flexible enough to include nutritious whole grains, legumes, and fruits in controlled portions.

          "Our plans are designed primarily for Type 2 diabetes management, where diet plays a major role in blood sugar control. If you have Type 1 diabetes, low-carb eating can still be beneficial, but you should work with your endocrinologist to adjust insulin dosing as your carb intake changes. Always consult your healthcare team before making significant dietary changes.",

        question: "What fruits can I eat on a low-carb diabetes plan?",

          "Berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries) are the best choice — they're low glycemic and high in fiber. We also include small portions of apples, pears, and citrus fruits. Tropical fruits like bananas and mangoes appear rarely and in controlled amounts since they have a higher glycemic impact.",

        question: "Will this plan help reduce my A1C?",
        answer:
          "Many people see measurable A1C improvements within 3-6 months of consistent low-carb eating. Studies show low-carb diets can reduce A1C by 0.5-1.0% on average. However, results depend on your starting point, medication, activity level, and consistency. Track your progress with your doctor.",

        question: "Can I still eat bread and pasta?",
        answer:
          "In moderation, yes. We use controlled portions of whole grain or legume-based pasta and bread, always paired with protein and fat to slow glucose absorption. A quarter-cup of whole wheat pasta as part of a balanced meal has a very different blood sugar impact than a large bowl of white pasta on its own.",
