        question: "What about grocery shopping with ADHD?",
        answer:
          "Our grocery lists are short, organized by store section, and designed for one trip. Use the list on your phone so you don't forget it at home. Many of our ingredients are shelf-stable, so you can stock up on good days and coast on hard ones. Online grocery ordering is also a great option.",

    intro:
      "You pick up your phone to check the time and 40 minutes later you're watching a stranger make a pasta dish you'll never cook. What if you actually made that pasta instead? This meal plan is designed to replace screen time with kitchen time — hands-on recipes that keep you engaged, meals meant to be eaten at a table without a phone, and cooking projects that are more satisfying than any feed. It's not about restriction. It's about doing something real with your hands and eating the result.",

        question: "How does cooking help with a social media detox?",
        answer:
          "Cooking occupies your hands, engages your senses, and produces a tangible result. It replaces the dopamine loop of scrolling with a slower, more satisfying kind of reward. You can't check your phone when you're kneading dough or flipping a stir-fry. And at the end, you have something real to show for your time.",

      {
        question: "What if I'm not a good cook?",
        answer:
          "The point isn't perfection — it's presence. Even a simple meal made with attention feels different from food eaten while scrolling. Our plans range from simple assembly meals to more involved projects, so you can start wherever you are. The cooking itself is the activity.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I have to cook every meal from scratch?",
        answer:
          "No. Breakfasts and lunches are quick and simple. The hands-on, phone-free focus is mainly on dinner — one intentional meal a day where you put the phone down, cook something, and eat it at a table. The rest of the day is normal.",

      {
        question: "Can I listen to music or a podcast while cooking?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely. The goal is to replace mindless scrolling, not to sit in silence. Put on an album, listen to a podcast, or cook with someone else. Just keep the phone out of your hands and off the counter. A Bluetooth speaker in the kitchen is a great investment.",
