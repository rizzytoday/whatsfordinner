        question: "How many calories does an athlete need?",
        answer:
          "It depends on your sport, body weight, and training volume. Endurance athletes may need 3,000-5,000 calories/day. Strength athletes typically need 2,500-4,000. Our plans ask about your sport, training frequency, and goals, then calibrate calorie and macro targets accordingly. You can always adjust if you're gaining or losing weight unintentionally.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to eat differently on rest days?",
        answer:
          "Slightly. Rest days need fewer carbs since you're not burning glycogen, but protein stays high for recovery. Our plans include separate rest-day meals with adjusted macros — you're not eating 4,000 calories of pasta on a couch day.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can this replace sports supplements?",
        answer:
          "For most athletes, whole food covers 90% of nutritional needs. Our plans may include protein powder in smoothies or oatmeal for convenience, but the core nutrition comes from real food. Creatine, caffeine, and sport-specific supplements are beyond what a meal plan covers — consult a sports dietitian for those.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much will this grocery bill be?",
        answer:
          "Athletes eat more, so groceries cost more — typically $100-150/week for one person. The caloric demands require more protein and carb sources. We keep costs reasonable by using chicken thighs, eggs, canned tuna, oats, rice, and sweet potatoes as staples rather than expensive supplements or specialty foods.",

The cooking happens in one batch session — ideally when your partner is on baby duty, or during a longer nap. One hour of cooking yields a week of meals.",

Our plans include calorie-dense, nutrient-rich meals and remind you to drink water throughout the day. We include foods known to support milk supply like oats, flaxseed, and leafy greens.",

Many new parent households have a friend or family member who wants to help — our prep guide makes it easy to hand them a grocery list and say 'make these.'",
