        question: "Why 21 days specifically?",
        answer:
          "The 21-day habit formation concept comes from behavioral psychology — it's roughly how long it takes for a new behavior to start feeling automatic. Three weeks of meal planning is enough to build the routine of checking your plan, shopping with a list, and prepping ahead. After 21 days, most people find they can't go back to winging it.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is a 21-day plan good for a diet reset?",
        answer:
          "It's excellent for a reset. Three weeks is long enough to break old patterns like relying on takeout or skipping meals, but short enough to feel achievable. The structured plan removes willpower from the equation — you just follow the meals and let the habit build itself.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I handle grocery shopping for 21 days?",
        answer:
          "We recommend shopping weekly within the 21-day plan. Each week's grocery list is separate, so you're buying fresh produce every 7 days rather than trying to stock up for the entire stretch. Think of it as three connected weekly plans rather than one massive haul.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens after the 21 days are over?",
        answer:
          "By then, meal planning should feel like second nature. Our weekly subscription keeps the momentum going with a fresh 7-day plan every Monday. You've built the habit — we keep fueling it with new recipes and variety so you never plateau.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I do a 21-day plan with dietary restrictions?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely. Set your preferences — vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, low-carb, or any combination — and every meal across all 21 days will respect those restrictions. You can also note allergies and ingredients you dislike.",

        question: "How is a 30-day plan structured?",
        answer:
          "Think of it as four connected weekly plans. Each week has its own grocery list so you're shopping fresh every 7 days. The meals are varied across the full month — we avoid repeating recipes and intentionally rotate cuisines, proteins, and cooking methods so week four feels as fresh as week one.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use a 30-day plan for a specific diet challenge?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Set your dietary preferences to match your challenge — whether that's Whole30-style, plant-based, low-carb, or calorie-controlled — and every meal across all 30 days will align. Having a structured plan removes the temptation to break your challenge because you always know what's next.",
      },
      {
        question: "Will I get bored eating planned meals for a full month?",
        answer:
          "The opposite, actually. Without a plan, most people rotate through the same 5-7 meals. Our 30-day plans introduce 60-90 unique recipes spanning multiple cuisines and cooking styles. You'll eat more variety in one planned month than most people eat in three unplanned months.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much money can I save with a 30-day meal plan?",
        answer:
          "Most families save 20-30% on food costs when following a meal plan versus shopping without one. Over 30 days, that adds up fast — less impulse buying, less food waste, and fewer takeout orders. Many subscribers report saving $200-400 per month after switching to planned meals.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if my schedule changes mid-month?",
        answer:
          "Plans are flexible. Swap days around, skip a meal and use leftovers, or regenerate a week's plan if your preferences change. The structure is there to support you, not box you in. Life happens — the plan adapts.",
