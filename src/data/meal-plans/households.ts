        question: "Can I cook these meals in a dorm room?",
        answer:
          "Most of our college meals are designed for minimal equipment — a microwave, a hot plate, or a single pan. We mark which recipes need an oven or stove so you can skip them if you only have a microwave. Mug meals, no-cook bowls, and microwave recipes are heavily featured.",

        answer:
          "We target under $30 per week for groceries. That's about $4 per day for three meals and a snack. We achieve this by using staples like rice, beans, eggs, pasta, canned tuna, and frozen vegetables — all available at any grocery store or even a convenience store.",

        question: "I don't know how to cook anything — can I still use this?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Our college plans assume you're starting from zero. Recipes include exact steps like 'heat the pan on medium for 2 minutes' rather than assuming you know what 'sautee until translucent' means. If you can boil water and crack an egg, you can make these meals.",

        question: "Can meal planning help me study better?",

          "Absolutely. Regular, balanced meals stabilize blood sugar and improve focus. Our plans include complex carbs for sustained energy, protein for alertness, and omega-3s for brain function. Students who eat regular meals consistently perform better academically than those who skip meals or eat erratically.",

The unhealthy part of fast food is the processed ingredients, not the speed. Our meals use whole, fresh ingredients cooked efficiently.",

        question: "Do I need special kitchen equipment for quick cooking?",
        answer:
          "A sharp knife, a good skillet, and a pot for boiling. That's it. Speed in cooking comes from organization and simple techniques, not gadgets. We avoid recipes that require specialty equipment like pressure cookers or air fryers, though both can speed things up further if you have them.",
