        question: "Should I go low-carb for PCOS?",
        answer:
          "Not necessarily. While reducing refined carbs helps with insulin resistance, going very low-carb can stress the adrenals and worsen symptoms for some women. Research shows moderate carb intake (about 40% of calories) from whole food sources works well for most people with PCOS. Our plans use this balanced approach rather than extreme restriction.",

          "Diet is the single most impactful lever for PCOS weight management. Studies show that even a 5-10% reduction in body weight can restore ovulation and improve insulin sensitivity. Our plans focus on steady, sustainable nutrition rather than crash dieting, which can actually worsen hormonal imbalances in PCOS.",

        question: "Are there foods that make PCOS worse?",
        answer:
          "Refined sugars, white bread, sugary drinks, processed snacks, and excessive dairy can worsen insulin resistance and inflammation. Trans fats and highly processed vegetable oils are also inflammatory. Our plans minimize all of these while still including satisfying meals -- you won't feel like you're on a restrictive medical diet.",

    intro:
      "High cholesterol doesn't mean a lifetime of dry salads and tasteless food. The science is clear: specific foods can actively lower LDL cholesterol -- soluble fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, plant sterols, and nuts can reduce LDL by 20-30% when combined consistently. We build weekly meal plans that pack these cholesterol-lowering foods into every day so you're actively improving your numbers with every meal, not just avoiding the bad stuff.",

        answer:
          "For many people, yes. The Portfolio Diet has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol by 20-30% -- comparable to statin drugs for some patients. The key is consistency: regularly eating soluble fiber, plant protein, nuts, and omega-3 rich foods. Our plans make this easy by building these foods into every day without you having to track anything.",

      {
        question: "What are the best foods for lowering LDL cholesterol?",
        answer:
          "The strongest evidence supports: oats and barley (beta-glucan fiber), beans and lentils (soluble fiber), almonds and walnuts (plant sterols and healthy fats), fatty fish like salmon and mackerel (omega-3s), olive oil (monounsaturated fat), and soy protein. Our meal plans incorporate all of these throughout the week.",
      },
      {
        question: "Should I avoid all saturated fat with high cholesterol?",
        answer:
          "You don't need to eliminate saturated fat entirely, but reducing it makes a real difference. The biggest sources to cut are processed meats, full-fat cheese, butter, and fried foods. Our plans use olive oil instead of butter, lean poultry instead of red meat, and moderate portions of cheese when included. Small swaps add up to big changes in your lipid panel.",
      },
      {
        question: "How quickly can diet changes improve cholesterol numbers?",
        answer:
          "Dietary changes can begin lowering LDL cholesterol within 2-3 weeks, with significant improvements typically seen at the 6-8 week mark. That's why most doctors recommend trying diet and lifestyle changes for 3 months before considering medication. Our weekly plans give you a structured, consistent approach for that critical window.",

        question: "Are eggs bad for high cholesterol?",
        answer:
          "Current research shows that dietary cholesterol from eggs has a much smaller impact on blood cholesterol than saturated fat does. Most health organizations say 1 egg per day is fine for most people, even with high cholesterol. Our plans include eggs in moderation, focusing more on reducing saturated fat and increasing soluble fiber, which have a much larger effect on your numbers.",

          "What nutrients are most important for hypothyroidism?",
        answer:
          "Selenium, iodine, and zinc are the three most critical nutrients for thyroid function. Selenium is needed to convert T4 to active T3 (the hormone your cells use). Iodine is a building block of thyroid hormones. Zinc supports TSH production. Our plans are designed to provide optimal amounts of all three through food sources like Brazil nuts, seafood, eggs, and lean meats.",
      },
      {
        question: "Should I avoid broccoli and kale with hypothyroidism?",
        answer:
          "No -- this is one of the most common myths. Cruciferous vegetables contain goitrogens that can theoretically interfere with iodine uptake, but this only matters if you eat very large amounts raw AND have iodine deficiency. Cooking these vegetables reduces goitrogenic compounds by 80-90%. Our plans always cook cruciferous vegetables and pair them with iodine-rich foods, so you get the fiber and nutrient benefits safely.",
      },

        question:
          "Why is it so hard to lose weight with hypothyroidism?",
        answer:
          "Hypothyroidism slows your basal metabolic rate, meaning you burn fewer calories at rest. It can also cause water retention and fatigue that reduces activity levels. The solution isn't extreme calorie cutting (which further slows metabolism) but rather adequate nutrition with thyroid-supporting nutrients, consistent protein intake, and anti-inflammatory foods. Our plans target a moderate, sustainable deficit if weight loss is your goal.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "Can certain foods interfere with thyroid medication?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Take levothyroxine on an empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before eating. Calcium-rich foods, soy products, high-fiber foods, and coffee can all reduce medication absorption if consumed too close to your dose. Our meal plans are designed with breakfast timing in mind -- no calcium-heavy or soy-based breakfasts that would interfere with morning medication.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is soy bad for thyroid function?",
        answer:
          "Moderate soy intake is fine for most people with hypothyroidism, especially if your iodine levels are adequate. The concern is that soy isoflavones can interfere with thyroid hormone production and medication absorption in large amounts. Our plans use soy in moderation (edamame, occasional tofu) rather than as a primary protein source, and never at breakfast when you'd be taking medication.",
