## What's Next

### High Impact — Do Soon

- [ ] **Funnel analytics** — track landing → onboarding → free plan → signup → paid. Vercel Analytics alone isn't enough. Add Posthog or Plausible with custom events.
- [ ] **Welcome email** — new signups should get an email before their first plan lands. Introduce the product, set expectations, drive them back to dashboard.
- [ ] **Email open/click tracking** — Resend supports webhooks. Knowing which emails convert tells you what to double down on.
- [ ] **Swap single meal** — most requested feature. Let users replace one meal without regenerating the whole week.
- [ ] **Checkout return page** — after LemonSqueezy redirects back, poll subscription status for 30s before showing dashboard. Currently the user lands before the webhook fires.

### Growth

- [ ] **Free plan soft email gate** — ask for email before showing the free plan preview. Biggest acquisition lever sitting on the table. Even 20% opt-in = huge nurture list.
- [ ] **Social sharing card** — "My meal plan for the week" shareable image for Twitter/Instagram. Free distribution.
- [ ] **Pause/skip week** — subscribers want to skip without cancelling. High retention value.
- [ ] **Cancellation survey** — ask why before they cancel. Churn insight + last-chance save.
- [ ] **Annual upsell nudge** — show "switch to yearly, save 50%" banner on dashboard for monthly subscribers.

### SEO Expansion

- [ ] **Blog translations** — 18 articles × 10 locales. Same pattern as meal plans. Big long-term SEO value.
- [ ] **Language switcher** — translated pages need a way to navigate between locales. Currently no UI for this.
- [ ] **More pSEO categories** — specific health conditions (IBS, PCOS, thyroid), meal prep focused pages, budget cooking pages.

### Product Depth

- [ ] **Favorite meals** — save meals you loved, bias future plans toward them (feedback table exists, just needs UI).
- [ ] **Recipe ratings** (thumbs up/down) — `meal_feedback` table already exists, just needs proper UI.
- [ ] **Grocery delivery integration** — Instacart or AnyList. High value for conversion.
- [ ] **Leftover tracking** — mark unused ingredients, reduce next week's list.

### Technical Health

- [ ] **Webhook idempotency** — dedupe LemonSqueezy retries using event ID. Low effort, high safety.
- [ ] **Cron per-user timeout** — 90s timeout per user so one slow Claude call doesn't block everyone.
- [ ] **Error monitoring** — Sentry or similar. Flying blind on production errors right now.
- [ ] **Test suite** — promo system, cron, webhook handling at minimum.
